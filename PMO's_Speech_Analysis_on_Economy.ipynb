            "https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/pms-interaction-with-street-vendors-from-madhya-pradesh/?tag_term=pmspeech&comment=disable My colleague in the Union Council of Ministers, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri ji, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Bhai Shivraj ji, other members of the state cabinet, people associated with the administration, all the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Svanidhi Scheme and all my dear brothers and sisters who are attending this program from Madhya Pradesh and outside Madhya Pradesh.\n",
            "First of all, I extend my best wishes to all the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Svanidhi Scheme. A little while ago, I had the opportunity to talk to some beneficiaries. There is conviction in their expression and a hope is also visible. This faith is the greatest success and strength of the Pradhan Mantri Svanidhi Scheme. I respectfully salute the strength of your labor, your self-esteem and self-confidence.\n",
            "I also extend my best wishes to all the friends of the country who are moving ahead with Pradhan Mantri Svanidhi Scheme. I congratulate Madhya Pradesh and the team of Shivraj ji in particular because more than one lakh street vendors have benefited from the Svanidhi Scheme within two months due to their efforts.\n",
            "I think it is a great job to provide identity cards and certificates of vending to 4.5 lakh street vendors in such a short time notwithstanding the Corona pandemic. I am hopeful that other states will also draw inspiration from the efforts of Madhya Pradesh and will be encouraged and make concrete attempts to ensure that all our street vendor brothers and sisters in all the cities of India get money from banks.\n",
            "Friends, whenever there is such a major crisis in the world, or the epidemic occurs, the first and foremost effect is on our poor brothers and sisters. The poor have to suffer even if there is more rain, or cold or heat. The poor have a crisis of employment, a crisis of eatables, and he loses whatever savings he has made. The pandemic brings along all these problems with it. Our poor brothers and sisters, our labor friends, our street vendor colleagues, they have suffered the most during this pandemic.\n",
            "There were many who used to work in other cities, but had to return to their villages during the pandemic. And therefore, the efforts of the government and the country have been to make concerted efforts right from day one of the Corona pandemic to mitigate the sufferings of the poor. The country took care of the food and ration of the people who were in distress and also provided free gas cylinders.\n",
            "Lakhs of people were given employment through the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan. In the midst of several schemes for the poor, there was a very big segment which needed special attention. These were my street vendor brothers and sisters. The families of our lakhs of street vendor friends are dependent on their daily wages. Markets were closed down due to Corona, people started living inside their homes fearing for their lives, and as a result the business of our street vendor brothers and sisters was hit the hardest. The Pradhan Mantri Svanidhi Scheme has been launched to pull them out of their distress.\n",
            "The purpose behind this scheme is to ensure easy capital to the people so that they can make fresh beginning and can restart their work. They should not be compelled to pay high interests for the money borrowed. This has happened for the first time that the network of lakhs of street vendors has got a new identity and they have been connected with the system in a proper way. The Svanidhi scheme is an important milestone in the journey of self-finance to self-employment, from self-employment to self-sustenance and from self-sustenance to self-esteem.\n",
            "Friends, you have been told about the Svanidhi scheme. Colleagues I spoke to now are very much aware of it. But it is very essential that all the needy and every street vendor should know everything about this scheme. Only then, our poor brothers and sisters will be able to make benefit of it.\n",
            "This scheme has been simplified in such a way that every common man can connect with it. As our sister Archanaji was telling us just now how her work got done very easily. She did not have any difficulty. Such a system has been developed through the use of technology under which the street vendor friends will not have to stand in long queues to submit their papers. You can upload your application at the Common Service Center, in the municipality office, or in a bank branch. Not only this, the officials of the bank and municipality can also visit you to take your applications. You use the facility which you find is useful to you. Attempt has been made to make this system very simple.\n",
            "Friends, this is one such scheme in which you can get rid of interest altogether. In any case, there is a 7 percent rebate on interest under this scheme. But if you keep in mind some very small and basic things, then you will not even have to pay this. Like, if you repay the amount to the bank within a year, then you will get rebate in interest. Moreover, you will receive some money in your bank account as a reward in the form of cash back if you do digital transactions, like receiving and paying money through your mobile phone, paying the wholesaler and others with whom you do sale-purchase through mobile phone. That is the government will put some money in your account separately. In this way, your total savings will be more than the interest.\n",
            "Moreover, if you take the loan for the second time, there will be even greater loan facilities. If for the first time, you got 10,000 rupees and your performance was satisfactory, and if you need 15,000 rupees the second time, you will get 15,000 rupees. Accordingly, it can be 20,000, 25,000 and 30,000 rupees. And, at the outset, our Chaganlalji was saying that he wants to make it ten times to Rs. 100,000. I am overjoyed when I hear this.\n",
            "Friends, there has been a rapid rise in the trend of digital transactions in the country during the last 3-4 years. In the Corona period, we are all realizing how important it is. Now customers avoid paying money in cash. They make payments directly through mobile phone. Therefore, our street vendor colleagues should not lag behind in these digital transactions, and you can do it. We saw that Kushwahaji had put QR code on his hand cart. Now even in the big malls also this (cash transactions) does not happen. Our poor person is ready to learn anything which is new. Therefore, we have made a new beginning with the help of banks and digital payment providers. Now the representatives of the banks and organizations will come to your address and your carts and will offer QR code. They will also brief you about its use. I appeal to my street vendor colleagues to do maximum transactions digitally and set a new example before the world.\n",
            "Friends, we have also prepared a scheme to provide online platforms through the use of technology to our friends in catering business who are also known as street food vendors. Efforts are on to ensure that street food vendors are able to offer online delivery to their customers on the lines of big restaurants. And very soon, we will take it forward if you take the initiative. I am confident that the business of street vendors and hawkers will increase and so will be their earnings through these initiatives.\n",
            "Friends, we are working expeditiously on another scheme related to street vendors. It will be ensured to make the lives of all those street vendors who are connected with the Pradhan Mantri Svanidhi scheme easier and they get basic amenities. We will see whether my street vendor brothers and sisters have gas connection under the Ujjwala scheme, whether they have electricity connection, whether they are linked to Ayushman Bharat Yojana, whether they are getting the benefit of 90 paise per day and one rupee a month insurance scheme, whether they have concrete roof over their heads, and the government will make concrete efforts to plug any shortcomings. Those who are all these will be prioritized.\n",
            "Friends, there has been talks about the poor many a time in our country, but the work that has been done for the poor in the last six years has been executed according to a plan, so that he is connected to one scheme to another, so that he is empowered to fight poverty and come out of poverty by defeating it. There have been several steps and initiatives in that direction, which was not done earlier. Every area, every sector where the poor-victim-exploited-deprived-Dalits-tribal was in hardship, the government schemes have come to his strength.\n",
            "You recall, the poor of our country could not go to the doors of the banks for fear of paper work. Through the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, the bank accounts of over 40 crore poor and the lower middle class have been opened. Through these Jan-Dhan accounts, our poor people were connected with the banks and as a result he is getting cheaper loans and he has been freed from the shackles of moneylenders. It is through these bank accounts that the poor are getting houses without bribe and the farmers are getting direct benefit in their bank accounts. During the Corona crisis, about 31,000 crore rupees have been deposited in the Jan-Dhan accounts of over 20 crore sisters, and this has been made possible only through the Jan-Dhan Yojana. Similarly, over 94,000 crore rupees have been transferred directly in the bank accounts of over 10 crore farmers' families.\n",
            "Friends, our poor have made a new beginning by linking themselves with Jan-Dhan accounts and the banking system in these years. Very soon, our villages will also be connected with online markets on the lines of cities, and the referring market will reach our villages. This time, the country has taken a pledge regarding this on August 15. All the villages of the country will be connected with optical fiber in the next 1,000 days. Every village, every house will have a faster internet. The benefits of the digital revolution will also reach the villages and the poor faster. Like, the country has started Digital Health Mission. Every national will get a health ID. All your information will be there safely. Through this ID, you will be able to take online appointment with your doctor and show all the health reports online. You see it like this. First, there was Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, and then through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana there is insurance protection, then free treatment worth five lakh rupees under the Ayushman Bharat, and now easy treatment will be provided through the Digital Health Mission.\n",
            "Friends, it is the endeavor of the country to make the life of every national easier, every countryman becomes empowered and above all he is self-reliant. Recently, the government has launched a major scheme to provide better accommodation to friends like you in cities at an affordable rent. Through the One Country, One Ration Card scheme, you will be able to get your share of ration wherever you go in the country. Your right will accompany you wherever you go.\n",
            "Friends, now that you are starting your business afresh, you will have to take some precautions. As long as there is no vaccine for Corona, its dangers will remain there. Therefore, you have to keep in mind your as well as your customers' protection. Whether it is mask, cleaning of hands, cleanliness around you, or the distance of two yards, you have to compromise with these. Attempt also has to be made not to use the single use plastic. If you ensure maximum protection against Corona on your cart or pavement, the improving trust will also increase and your business will also grow. You have to obey these rules and also request others to follow them. Once again, many congratulations and best wishes for your new beginning. With this expectation that you and your family remain healthy, your businesses prosper; lots of best wishes.\n",
            "Thank you very much.\n",

            "Rajasthan's Governor Kalraj Mishraji, Chief Minister Shri Ashok Gehlotji, Gulab Kothariji of Rajasthan Patrika, other employees of the Patrika Group, friends in media, ladies and gentlemen !!!\n",
            "Warm greetings to Gulab Kothariji and the Patrika Group for Samvad Upanishad and Akshar Yatra books. These books are unique gifts to both literature and culture. Today, I have also got the opportunity to dedicate the Patrika Gate reflecting the culture of Rajasthan. This will become a center of attraction not only for the local residents but the tourists as well. Congratulations to all of you for this effort.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "In any society, the enlightened class of society, authors or writers of the society, are like mentors and teachers of the society. Our school education ends, but our learning process continues throughout our life, every day. There is an important role of books and authors in it. In our country, the continuous progress of writing has been with Indianness and nationality.\n",
            "During the freedom struggle, almost every big name was somehow associated with writing. We have had famous saints and scientists who were also authors and writers. I am happy that all of you are making constant efforts to keep that tradition alive. And the great thing is that the Rajasthan Patrika Group has the courage to say that we are not in the race of following the foreign countries blindly. You give priority to take forward the Indian culture, Indian civilization and integral values.\n",
            "Gulab Kothariji’s books, Samvad Upanishad and Akshar Yatra, are the vivid proof of this. The tradition that Gulab Kothariji has been pursuing today… the onset of the Patrika happened with these traditions. Karpoor Chandra Kulishji had launched the Patrika with the resolve of Indianness and service to India. All of us remember his contribution to journalism, but Kulishji’s efforts to take the knowledge of Vedas to the society was really wonderful. I had several opportunities to meet the late Kulishji personally. He liked me very much. He often used to say that journalism attains significance through positivity.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "It is not necessary that one can give something positive to the society only as a journalist or a writer. This positivity, this belief is also very necessary for our personality as an individual. I am satisfied that the Patrika Group and Gulab Kothariji have been constantly pursuing Kulishji's philosophy and commitment. Gulab Kothariji, you would recall that when I had called a meeting of friends of the print media regarding Corona, then also I had told you on your suggestions and advices that your words remind me of your father. Samvad Upanishad and Akshar Yatra demonstrate how strongly you are taking forward your father’s Vedic heritage.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "While I was going through the books of Gulabji, I recalled one of his editorials. Kothariji had written 'Stutya Sankalp' on my first address to the nation after the 2019 election results. He had written that after listening to me, he felt as if I had conveyed his words to the 130 crore countrymen. Kothariji, whenever I get understanding on Upanishad and Vedic discourses in your books, I feel at times as if I am reading my own expressions.\n",
            "In fact, no matter whose words are there for the welfare of the human being or for the service of the common man, they are related to everyone’s heart. That is why our Vedas, views of Vedas have been called eternal. Whosoever visionary sages are behind the Veda mantras, their spirit and philosophy is for human beings. Therefore, our Vedas and our culture are for the entire world. I expect that Upanishad Samvad and Akshar Yatra will also reach the people in the same way as the Indian philosophy has. Today, in this era of texts and tweets, it is more important that our new generation is not weaned away from serious knowledge.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "This understanding of our Upanishads, the philosophy of the Vedas, is not just a sphere of spiritual or philosophical attraction. There is a philosophy of creation and science in Vedas and Vedanta which has attracted so many scientists and several scientists have shown keen interest in it. We all must have heard the name of Nikola Tesla. Without Tesla, the modern world would not have been such as we see it. When Swami Vivekananda had gone to America a century ago, he met Nikola Tesla. Tesla was shocked when Swami Vivekananda told him about the understanding of the Upanishads and the interpretation of the Universe in Vedanta.\n",
            "The way the Universe has been discussed in detail with Sanskrit words like Akash and Pran, Tesla said he would bring it into mathematical equations in the language of modern science. He felt that he could solve several mysteries of science through this knowledge. However, there were many other researches that took place after that but several things came before us in different ways following the discussion between Swami Vivekananda and Nikola Tesla. Still, many researches are taking place. But somewhere this one context inspires us to rethink about our knowledge. Today, our youth also need to know, think and understand in this sense. Therefore, a book like Samvad Upanishad and deeper churning on Akshar Yatra will open a new dimension for our youth and will give them ideological depth.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "Letters are the first unit of our language and our expression. The meaning of letter in Sanskrit is which cannot be eroded, i.e., it remains forever. This is the power of concept. This is the strength. The concept and knowledge that the sage, seer, scientist or the philosopher gave us thousands of years ago, it is still taking the world forward. Therefore, there is a mention of Akshar Brahma in our Upanishads and scriptures and there is a doctrine of 'Akshar Brahma Paramam'. It is said in our scriptures: - \"The word Brahmani nishtah: Param brahmadhi gachhti\" i.e., the word is Universe. One who is fully able to understand this word Universe, he is able to attain divinity.\n",
            "Nowhere does one find such an example of the glory of the word, the word being described as god. Therefore, the courage to speak truth through words, the power to give positivity through words, the idea behind creation of words, is the nature of the Indian psyche. This is our nature. When we realize this strength, we understand our importance and the responsibility towards the society as a writer or as an author.\n",
            "You see, the media has helped in increasing awareness in all the programmes, whether it is Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to provide toilets for the poor, to prevent many diseases, or the Ujjwala Gas Yojana which protects mothers and sisters from the smoke of woods, or the Jal Jeevan Mission under which drinking water will be made available to each household. The media has also done an unprecedented service by spreading awareness against the Corona during this pandemic. Our media has been doing well to analyze the works of the government, to point out and criticize the shortcomings of the government schemes at the grassroots level. Yes, there are times when the media is also criticized; it has become even more common in the era of social media. But, it is equally important to learn from criticism. That is why, today, our democracy has been so strong and strengthened.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "The way we are going ahead with our heritage, science, culture and our potential, and we are pursuing it, we have to carry forward this self-confidence. When we talk about Atmanirbhar Bharat, or Vocal for Local, I am happy that the media is giving our resolve the shape of a big campaign. Friends, we need to expand this vision further.\n",
            "India’s local products are going global, but India’s voice is also becoming global. Now, the world listens to India more carefully. There is a strong presence of India at almost all the international forums. As such, there is also the need for the Indian media to be global. There should be global reputation of our newspapers and magazines; we should reach the entire world digitally in this digital era; Indian organizations should give awards the way different literary awards are given in the world. This is also the need of the day today. It is also necessary for the country.\n",
            "I am aware that the Patrika Group has launched an international journalism award in the memory of Shri Karpoor Chandra Kulishji. I congratulate the Group for this. I am confident that these efforts will give India a new identity on the global media platform. Once again, I congratulate you for the way the Patrika Group has done the work of public awareness during the Corona period. This campaign still needs to be intensified. Our countrymen also remain healthy, and the economy also gets momentum, this is the priority of the country today. I am confident that the country will soon win this battle and the country’s journey will also become Akshar Yatra.\n",
            "With these best wishes, many many thanks to all of you!\n",

            "First of all, I am thankful to the honorable President. This conference is very relevant and important in the context of the National Education Policy. Today’s gathering together has hundreds of years of teaching experience. I welcome and greet you all.\n",
            "Sir,\n",
            "The education policy and education system is a very important medium in meeting the aspirations of the country. The central government, the state government, the local bodies, all are associated with the responsibility of the education system. But this is also true that there should be bare minimum interference and influence of the government in the education policy. The more the teachers, parents and students are involved in the education policy, its relevance and prevalence also increases.\n",
            "Work on the National Education Policy began 4-5 years ago. Lakhs of people from villages and cities across the country and the experienced people associated with the education sector had given their feedback and suggestions. More than two lakh people had also offered their suggestions on the different aspects of the draft education policy. That means parents, students, academicians, teachers, education managers, professionals, all have contributed in this regard. The National Education Policy is now being welcomed everywhere due to the nectar that has emerged after such profound, extensive and diversified discussions.\n",
            "Everybody, be it a teacher in a village or reputed academicians, is finding the National Education Policy as their own education policy. Everybody feels that these were the reforms that they wanted to see in the previous education policy. This is the major reason behind acceptance to the National Education Policy.\n",
            "The nation has taken one more step forward after deciding the format of the education policy. There is widespread discussion and debate in the country regarding the National Education Policy and its implementation. This comprehensive discussion is also necessary because the National Education Policy is not just limited to reforms in the methods of schooling. This policy is going to give a new direction to the social and economic spheres of the 21st century India.\n",
            "This policy will shape the resolve and competence of a self-reliant India. Naturally, our preparations and awareness should also be in sync with this enormous resolve. Most of you have studied the nuances of the National Education Policy. Therefore, it is equally important that there should be continuous discussion on the nuances and the purposes of the reform of this magnitude. The country will be able to successfully implement the National Education Policy after resolving all the doubts and questions.\n",
            "Sir,\n",
            "Today the world is widely debating the rapidly changing jobs and the nature of work. This policy will prepare the youth of the country on the two fronts of knowledge and skills in keeping with the demands of the future. The new education policy focuses on learning rather than studying and emphasizes on critical thinking beyond the curriculum. There is a strong emphasis on passion, practicality and performance rather than the process. There is also focus on foundation learning and languages; learning outcomes and teacher training. Widespread reforms have been implemented on access and assessment in this policy. It demonstrates a way to empower each student.\n",
            "In a way, this is a solid attempt to take the one-size-fits-all approach out of our education system. And all of you veterans also feel that this is not an ordinary but an extra-ordinary attempt. In this policy, there has been extensive discussion to remove all the deficiencies and problems which we found in our decades-old education policy. For long, there have been raging debates regarding children being burdened with bags and board exams and are under the pressure of family and society. This policy addresses this problem in an effective way. It is said in our country that sa vidya or liberation ie i.e., knowledge should be such which liberates our mind.\n",
            "When the children will be connected with their culture, language and traditions at the foundation stage, the education will not only become very effective and easy, but the children will also relate to it. Under the National Education Policy, the democratic values ​​of learning without any pressure, paucity and influence have been made part of our education policy in a real sense. The pressure on the students regarding streams, have been done away with.\n",
            "Now, our youths would be able to study according to their interest and aptitude. Earlier, the students used to choose a stream beyond their capability due to pressure. By the time they would realize this, it would be very late. The result was the student would either drop out or somehow complete his degree. I understand it, in fact, you know better than me that this has created so many problems in our country; this was the root of several problems. While there is a solution to these problems in the National Education Policy, the students will also greatly benefit from the academic bank of credit.\n",
            "Sir,\n",
            "It is very essential for the youth to be skillful in order to make India self-reliant. Our youth will be better prepared for the future due to vocational exposure since childhood. Practical learning will not only increase employability of our young friends in the country, but their participation will also increase in the global job market. It is said in our country that aa no bhadra: kratvo yanti vishvatya i.e., one should accept good ideas, no matter from which direction they come. India has been a global center of knowledge from ancient times. We are striving to make India a knowledge economy in the 21st century. The new education policy is a big step in the direction of achieving this resolve.\n",
            "The new National Education Policy has opened doors for establishment of the best international institution campuses in India for youths of ordinary families and to tackle brain drain. When the international level top campuses are established in the country, the trend to go abroad for education will also reduce and our universities and colleges will also become more competitive. Online education is another aspect of it, which ends all the limitations regarding local or international schooling.\n",
            "Sir,\n",
            "There is bound to be some doubts and apprehensions when there are widespread changes in any system and we move towards the creation of a new system. The parents will think that if the students get so much freedom, if the streams are done away with, how will they get admission in colleges, what will happen to the careers of their children? There will be questions in the minds of the professors and teachers how they will prepare themselves for the new changes. How will the new curriculum be managed?\n",
            "There will be several questions and you are discussing them as well. Most of these questions relate to its implementation, like how the curriculum will be designed, how the syllabus and content will be prepared in local languages? Regarding libraries, regarding the digital and online content of education which has been proposed in the policy, how will these take place. Whether we will not miss our goals in the absence of resources? Naturally, there will be several questions regarding administration in your mind. All these questions are important also.\n",
            "We are all working together to solve each question. There is a continuous dialogue taking place in the Ministry of Education. The views and feedback of each and every stakeholder in the states are also being heard with an open mind. Ultimately, we all have to sort out all the doubts and apprehensions. The way this policy has come about with flexibility of vision, similarly, we will all have to demonstrate maximum flexibility for its implementation.\n",
            "This education policy is not the government’s education policy. This is the country’s education policy. Just as the foreign and defense policies are the policies of the nation and referring belong to any government, similarly the education policy is also the education policy of the country, no matter which government is there, or who is ruling the country. This policy came after 30 years because it is not bound by the governments, but represents the aspirations of the country.\n",
            "Sir,\n",
            "In view of the rapidly changing times, comprehensive provisions have been made in the National Education Policy keeping in view the future. As technology is expanding to villages and is becoming accessible to the poorest of the poor in the country, the deprived, the backward and the tribal communities, their access to information and knowledge is also increasing.\n",
            "Today I find that several young friends are running channels on the video streaming sites through their video blogs, making better coaching available on each and every subject. This was something the poor boy or girl could not even imagine. There has been sharp decline in the problem of regional and social imbalance due to the reach of the technology. This is our responsibility that we promote maximum technological solutions in each university and college.\n",
            "Sir,\n",
            "Any system can be as effective and inclusive, as much better its governance model. This policy represents the same approach regarding governance. Attempts are being made that every aspect of higher education, be it academic, technical or vocational, every type of education is brought out from silos. The policy has attempted to ensure better coordination by keeping administrative layers to the minimum. The regulation of higher education will be further simplified and streamlined through this policy.\n",
            "The effort behind the concept of graded autonomy is to encourage healthy competition among every college and university and the institutions should be rewarded according to their performance. This is our collective responsibility that we implement the purpose of the National Education Policy (NEP-2020) in letter and spirit. This is my special request to all of you to organize more such virtual conferences in the universities of your states and Union Territories before September 25. The idea is to have the better understanding of the National Education Policy as we move ahead. Once again, I offer my gratitude to all of you for taking your time out.\n",
            "I once again express my gratitude to the respected President. Many many best wishes to all of you.\n",
            "Thanks !!!\n",

            "https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/pms-address-at-dikshant-parade-of-ips-probationers-through-video-conference/?tag_term=pmspeech&comment=disable Namaskar!\n",
            "My colleagues in the council of ministers, Shri Amit Shah ji, Dr. Jitendra Singh ji, G. Kishan Reddy ji, officials of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy present on the occasion of the Dikshant (Convocation) Parade Event and my young friends of 71 RR ready to lead the Indian Police Service with youthful zeal.\n",
            "Generally, I used to meet all the friends who would pass out of this academy personally in Delhi. It used to be my good fortune that I would call them at my residence and would exchange ideas with them. Due to the prevalent situation in the wake of Corona, I am losing out on this opportunity. But I am sure that I will meet you sometime during my tenure.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "One thing is certain that as long as you are working as a trainee, you work in a protective environment. You know that in the event of a mistake, your colleague or the people who are providing training to you will take care of it. But the situation will change overnight. The moment you step out of this academy, you will not remain in the protective environment. A common man will not think that you are new and lack experience. He will think that he is Sahib and in uniform, why is my work not being done? You are Sahib, how can you do this? His attitude towards you will change completely.\n",
            "You will be minutely monitored on how do you conduct yourself, how do you function.\n",
            "I would like you to remain over conscious during your initial period because the first impression is the last impression. Once you are typecast as a particular officer that image will travel with you wherever you are transferred. It will take you considerable time to come out of that image. Therefore, you make efforts very carefully.\n",
            "Secondly, there is a defect in the society. When we also come to Delhi after being elected, two-four people stick around us. We don’t know who they are. And very soon they will start offering their service. Sahib, if you need a car, or water, I will arrange it for you. I think you have not eaten so far. The food of this Bhavan is not good, should I bring food from a different Bhavan. We don’t know who these service providers are. Wherever you will go, you will also find a group of such people. You will be new to the place and you will also be in need of several requirements. But if you get trapped in it, it will be very difficult to come out of that rut. Initially, you will have problems because the area is new, but try to understand things from your own eyes and ears. As far as possible, filter your ears in your initial days.\n",
            "If you really want to succeed in leadership, filter your ears. I don’t say that you should keep your ears closed. I am only asking you to filter your ears. You will benefit a lot when all those things necessary for your career, your duty or as a person are received by you in a filtered way. Whenever somebody goes for a posting, people consider him to be a dustbin. The more powerful the person is, he is dubbed as a bigger dustbin. People keep on piling trash. And we also consider that trash as fortune. If we keep our conscience clean, it will be very beneficial to us.\n",
            "The second issue is — Have we ever given a thought about the culture of our police stations? How can our police station become a centre of social trust? Today, when we visit police stations, they are clean, it is good. There are some police stations in some areas which are very old and are in a dilapidated condition. I know that but it is not difficult to keep them clean.\n",
            "We should decide that wherever I go, I will ensure 12-15 things which I have jotted down on a paper, are properly implemented at all the police stations under me, be it 50, 100 or 200. It is difficult to change a person, but the system can be changed. The environment can be changed. Can this be in your priority list? And how to keep files properly, offer seats to people who visit you. These are very small things which you should do.\n",
            "Some policemen when they initially join duty feel that they should show off their authority, make people fear them and hold them in awe. And the anti-social elements should shudder at the mere mention of my name. The people who grow up watching films like Singham entertain these kinds of thoughts. The result is that several important works are left out. You should try to bring about qualitative change in the 100-200-500 people who work under you, to prepare a better team. You see, people’s attitude will change towards you.\n",
            "You should decide whether you want to inspire awe among common man, or you want to build bridges of affection with them. If you try to create influence, it will be very short-lived. But if you build bridges of affection with people, they will remember you even after your retirement. The people of the area, where you had joined first, would remember you as a person who 20 years ago had come here, did not know the local language, but had won the hearts of the people through his behavior. Once you win the heart of the common man, everything will fall in place.\n",
            "There is a belief in policing system. When I became CM for the first time…… there is a new year in Gujarat soon after Diwali. There is a small function where police personnel hold a Diwali Milan programme when chief ministers visit them regularly. I also used to go there. The previous chief ministers would go there, sit on a podium, would speak a few words, offer their best wishes and would leave. When I went for the first time, I met all the people. Then there was a police officer who stopped me. He told me why I was shaking hands with everybody. Don’t do it. Among them were constables and people from different walks of life. It used to be a gathering of 100-150 people. I asked him why? He told me that I would develop swelling in my hands by the evening if I continued shaking hands with everybody and I will need medical treatment. I told him, why did he think that way? But a notion that it will be like this in a police department, he will use abusive language, this is wrong.\n",
            "This artificial image of police in uniform is not the real version as was seen during the Corona crisis. He is also a human being. He is also performing his duty for the welfare of humanity. This image can be strengthened in society through our behavior. How can we change the entire character through our behavior?\n",
            "Similarly, I have seen that political leaders’ first interaction is with police. Those in uniform try to impress the political leaders. And you will find 5-50 among those who would clap very often to impress the political leaders.\n",
            "We should not forget that we are part of a democratic system. Whatsoever is the party in a democracy, the role of an elected representative is very important. To respect an elected representative is to respect the democratic process. There may be differences between the two, but there are ways to handle it. We should adopt that method. I am sharing my experience with you. When I became Chief Minister for the first time, Atul, who is now training you, used to train me. And I have been trained under him, because he was my security in-charge when I was CM.\n",
            "One day, it so happened. I do not feel mentally comfortable with all the paraphernalia and police arrangements. I find it very cumbersome, but I had to stay within them. However, sometimes, I would breach rules, get out of the car and shake hands with people in a crowd. One day, Atul Karwal sought my time and came to my chamber. I don’t know whether he remembers now, but he expressed his disapproval. He was very junior. I am talking about this incident which happened 20 years ago.\n",
            "He looked at his chief minister in the eye and expressed his disapproval. He told me that I could not do this, can’t get out of car on my own or mingle with the crowd. I told him whether he was the master of my life and would dictate to me what to do. He did not flinch. I am telling this in front of him. He did not flinch. He told me in no uncertain terms that I was not just a person but belonged to the state. And this is his responsibility to protect me. He requested me to follow rules, otherwise, he would ensure that rules are followed.\n",
            "I did not utter anything. This was the respect towards democracy, towards an elected representative, but also a way to say things in a polite way as part of his duty. Those were my early days as a Chief Minister. Why that incident has stuck on with me, because the way with which a police officer had made his point with such firmness while keeping in mind the importance of an elected representative. I think every police jawan can do this, anybody can do this. We need to look into it.\n",
            "One more topic is there. See, technology has proven to be very beneficial these days. Earlier policing was done through information and intelligence gathering at constabulary level and it was going on well. But, sadly, it has seen a decline. You should never ever compromise on this, because intelligence gathering at constabulary level is very important for policing. You should develop your assets and sources as much as you can, but you should also think about the staff at the police station and encourage them. But, now-a-days, technology is easily available. Technology is helping in a big way in detecting crimes these days, whether it is through CCTV cameras or through tracking mobile phones. It is good. But the number of policemen who get suspended now-a-days is also because of technology. Sometimes, they misbehave, get angry, lose their temperament and go overboard and a person shoots the incident in video without their knowledge. Then that video becomes viral. There is a huge media pressure. And many people can be found who are ready to speak against the police. In the end, the system has to suspend them for the time being. This blot stays on with their career.\n",
            "Technology is proving to be both a boon and a bane. Police have been largely affected. You will have to train people. You should emphasise on the constructive and maximum use of technology. And I have noticed that there are many people in this batch with technology background. There is no dearth of information now-a-days. There are several new tools like big data, artificial intelligence, social media, etc. which can be used to get the best result through analysis of information. You should make a team and should add people who work with you. And it is not necessary that everybody should be an expert in technology.\n",
            "I give you an example. There was a constable in my security when I was CM. I exactly don’t remember his actual designation. There was UPA government at the centre. There was a hitch in an email which was not getting resolved. And it was a matter of concern for the government. The news was widely reported in newspapers. There was a class 12th educated youngster in my team who took interest in it. And you will be surprised that he resolved it. I think Chidambaram ji used to be the Home Minister then. He called him and gave him a certificate. There are only a few people who have this kind of talent.\n",
            "We need to find them and make proper use of them. If you do this, you will find that you will have new weapons, they will become your strength. If you are a group of 100 policemen and if you use these assets, use technology while analyzing information, this 100 will turn into thousands. Such would be your strength, so emphasise on this.\n",
            "Secondly, you must have seen this. Earlier, the army personnel would rush in whenever there used to be natural calamities, floods, earthquake, or a big accident, cyclone, etc. It had become very natural for the people to heave a sigh of relief when they would see army personnel who they knew could provide big relief to them in getting out of that situation. In the last few years, similarly the personnel of SDRF and NDRF, who have been drawn from police, have done some excellent work and their work has been recognized by the TV as well. They are running in water, dust, or lifting huge stones. This has created a new image of the police department.\n",
            "I will request you all to prepare as many teams of SDRF and NDRF in your areas. These should be created in police as well as in people.\n",
            "If you have expertise in providing help to the people during natural calamities as part of your duty, then you can be very effective and now-a-days there are several such requirements. Today, it is because of NDRF and SDRF, a new image of police is being created in the country.\n",
            "People are saying this with pride that they arrived at the time of crisis, building had collapsed and they pulled out people who were trapped in it.\n",
            "I would like you to provide leadership in several areas. You must have realized the importance of training. We should never underestimate training. Most of the government officials consider training as punishment. This is the impression that if a particular person has been asked to undergo training, certainly he would be a non-performing officer. We have downgraded training so much that this is the root cause of the problems in good governance, and we need to come out of it.\n",
            "I would like to appreciate Atul Karwal again. Atul also comes from technology background, has climbed the Everest, and is very courageous. I don’t think it is difficult for him to get any post in the police department. A few years ago, he himself ventured to train the probationers in Hyderabad. This time also he himself sought the training work. What more can be important than this. I would like that it should be recognized.\n",
            "And therefore, the government has launched a new programme – Mission Karmayogi. The cabinet has approved it two days ago. We want to attach greater importance to this training activity in the form of Mission Karmayogi.\n",
            "I think it should be done and carried forward. I want to tell you one more experience of mine. I had made a 72-hour of training capsule in Gujarat and all the government officers had to undergo compulsory training for three days. And I used to take feedback of their experience.\n",
            "Initially, I had a meeting with the 250 people who underwent training in the first phase and sought their opinion about those 72 hours. Most of them said that it should be increased beyond 72 hours as it proved to be very beneficial. Then one policeman got up. I asked him about his experience. He told me that earlier he was just a policeman, but the 72-hour of training had made him a better human being. These words were very powerful. He said people never considered him as a human being; he was just a policeman in their eyes. He said those 72 hours of training made him realize that he was also a human being besides being a police man.\n",
            "This is the power of training. We need continuous training. Now after this parade, you should make it a point not to lower your guard even for a minute and you will practice it. You should think about your health and should enquire the health of your colleagues, whether they have been exercising, controlling their weight and getting their medical check-ups done regularly. You should emphasise on this because physical fitness is not just about your impressive appearance in uniform, but your work demands it. So, this is your duty and you will have to provide leadership in it. And it is said in our scriptures\n",

            "That is, the kind of conduct that the best people show, the rest of the people also behave like that.\n",
            "I am sure you are in the category of those and you are in the category of proving that excellence. You have got an opportunity but a responsibility as well. Every rule has its importance, but role is very important as you religiously perform your duties to protect mankind from the kind of challenges they are facing today, for the ever glory of the tricolor of our country and with full dedication to the Constitution of India.\n",
            "Should I perform rule-based or role-based? If we attach importance to our roles, then rules will automatically be followed. And if we follow our role properly, our trust among people will also grow.\n",
            "Once again, I extend my best wishes to all of you and I am confident that you will not be found wanting in enhancing the pride of Khaki. From my side, I will not let down in my responsibilities towards you, your family and your honour. With this confidence, I extend many many best wishes to you on this auspicious occasion.\n",

We were also among the earliest to create public awareness campaigns about social distancing. In record time, medical infrastructure was scaled up- be it Covid hospitals, ICU capacities and more. Starting from one testing lab in January, we now have around sixteen hundred labs across the country.\n",

Despite our large local needs, we did not shy away from our global responsibility. The responsibility of being the leading leading producer of generic medicines. We ensured constant supplies to the world. We are also at the fore-front of research on the vaccine for Covid-19. A self-reliant and peaceful India ensures a better world.\n",
            "‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ is about transforming India from being just a passive market to an active manufacturing hub at the heart of global value chains.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "The road further ahead is full of opportunities. These opportunities are in the public and private sector. They cover core economic sectors as well as the social sectors. Recent sectors that have opened include Coal, Mining, Railways, Defense, Space, and Atomic Energy.\n",
            "Production Linked Incentive schemes have been launched for- mobile & electronics, medical devices, pharma sectors - they have been well received. Such schemes are being planned for other Champion sectors too. Reforms in agricultural marketing and 14 billion US Dollars agriculture financing facility bring several opportunities.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "For challenges in India, you have a Government that believes in delivering results. A government for which Ease of living is as important as the Ease of doing business. You are looking at a young country with 65 percent population less than 35 years old. You are looking at an aspirational country that has decided to take the nation to new heights. This at a time when we mark 75 years of independence. You are looking at a country with political stability and policy continuity. You are looking at a country with commitment to democracy and diversity.\n",

            "Generally, this period is full of festivals; fairs are held at various places; it’s the time for religious ceremonies too. During these times of Corona crises, on the one hand people are full of exaltation and enthusiasm too; and yet in a way there’s also a discipline that touches our heart. Broadly speaking in a way, there is a feeling of responsibility amongst citizens. People are getting along with their day to day tasks, while taking care of themselves and others as well. At every event being organised in the country, the kind of patience and simplicity being witnessed this time is unprecedented. Even Ganeshotsav is being celebrated online at certain places; at most places eco-friendly Ganesh idols have been installed. Friends, if we observe very minutely, one thing will certainly draw our attention- our festivals and the environment. There has always been a deep connect between the two. On the one hand, our festivals implicitly convey the message of co-existence with the environment and nature; on the other, many festivals are celebrated precisely for protecting nature. For example, in West Champaran district of Bihar, people belonging to Thaaru tribal community have been observing a sixty-hour lockdown for centuries…..in their own words- ‘Saath ghante ke Barna’. The Thaaru community has adopted BARNA as a tradition for protection of nature; that too for centuries. During this period, neither does anyone enter the village, nor leave home, and they believe that if they step out or if someone enters from elsewhere, the to and fro movement along with other routine activities of people can lead to the destruction of new plants and trees. Our tribal brothers and sisters begin the Barna lockdown with a grand worship and conclude with jestful traditional tribal songs, music and dance programmes.\n",
            "Friends, these days, the festival of Onam is also being celebrated with gaiety and fervour. This festival arrives in the month of Chingam. During this period, people buy something new, decorate their homes, prepare Pookalam and enjoy Onam-Saadiya… variety of games and competitions are also held. The zest of Onam today has reached distant shores of foreign lands. Be it America, Europe or Gulf countries, the verve of Onam can be felt everywhere. Onam is increasingly turning out to be an international festival.\n",
            "Friends, Onam is a festival linked with our agriculture. It is also the time of a new beginning for our rural economy. Our lives, our society derive sustenance from the fortitude of farmers. Their perseverance lends myriad hues to our festivals.\n",
            "In the Vedas too, our food provider, Annadaata, the life sustaining shakti of our farmers has been gloriously venerated. There is a mantra in Rigved –\n",
            "Annanam PatayeNamah\n",
            "Kshetranam PatayeNamah\n",
            "Which means,\n",
            "Bow to the food provider\n",
            "Salute to the farmer.\n",
            "Even during these trying times of Corona, our farmers have proven their mettle. This time around in our country, sowing of kharif crops has increased by 7 percent compared to last year. The sowing of paddy has increased by approximately 10 percent, pulses close to 5 percent, coarse cereals almost 3 percent, oilseeds around 13 percent and cotton nearly 3 percent. For this I extend felicitations to the farmers of our country…I salute their perseverance.\n",
            "My dear countrymen, during this time period of Corona, the country is fighting on many fronts simultaneously. But at the same time, the question that frequently comes to mind is, how my young little friends are spending their time while they remain homebound for so long.\n",
            "And this is why, I, together with the Children University of Gandhinagar, a unique experiment in the world, Indian government’s Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises, pondered and deliberated over, what we can do for our children. It was a very useful and pleasant experience for me, because in a way it became an opportunity for me to know and learn something new.\n",
            "Friends, the subject that we contemplated over was – toys and especially Indian toys. We discussed how to make new toys available to the children of India, how India could become a big hub of toy production. By the way, I apologize to the parents, listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’, as, after this, they might face an additional task of hearing out new demands for toys. Friends, whereas toys augment activity, they also give flight to our aspirations. Toys, not only entertain, they also build the mind and foster an intent too. I read somewhere what Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had said about toys, the best toy is that which is incomplete; a toy that children together complete  while playing. Gurudev Tagore had said that during his childhood, he used to make his own toys and games with his friends, with materials available at home, using his own imagination. But, one day elders interfered with those fun-filled moments of childhood. It so happened that one of his friends brought a big and beautiful foreign toy. Now, all their attention was more on flaunting the toy than the game. That toy became the centre of attraction for everyone, not the game. The child who hitherto used to play and mingle with everyone, and remain immersed in the game; the same child started to act aloof. In a way, the feeling of being distinct from the rest of the children, took over his mind. In that expensive toy, there was nothing to create; nor was there anything to learn. That is, an appealing toy had subdued, veiled and withered a brilliant child. This toy exuded pomposity, it exhibited wealth and a little nobility, but it curtailed the growth and grooming of the child’s creative spirit.  The toy remained, but the game was over and the blossoming of the child stopped too. Therefore, Gurudev used to say that, toys should be such that they bring out the childhood of a child and also his or her creativity. In the National Education Policy, a lot of attention has been given on the impact of toys on different aspects of children’s lives. Learning while playing, learning to make toys, visiting toy factories, all these have been made part of the curriculum. Friends, there has been a rich tradition of local toys in our country. There are many talented and skilled artisans who possess expertise in making good toys. Some parts of India are developing also as Toy clusters, that is, as centres of toys. Like, Channapatna in Ramnagaram in Karnataka, Kondaplli in Krishna in Andhra Pradesh, Thanjavur in Tamilnadu, Dhubari in Assam, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh – there are many such places, we can count many names. You will be surprised to know that the Global Toy Industry is of more than 7 lakh crore rupees. Such a big business of 7 lakh crore rupees but, India’s share is very little in this. Now, just spare a thought for a nation which has so much of heritage, tradition, variety, young population, will it feel good to have such little share in the toy market? Not at all, you too won’t feel good after hearing this. Friends, the toy Industry is very vast. Be it cottage industries, small industries, MSMEs and along with this big industries and private entrepreneurs too come in the ambit of this. The country will have to persevere together to promote this. Further like, there is Mr. C V Raju in Vishakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh. Once the Eti- Koppakaa toys of his village were very popular. The speciality of these toys – these were made of wood, and secondly, you would not find any angles or corners in these toys anywhere. These toys were round from all sides hence there was no scope for injury to children. C V Raju has now started a sort of a new movement for eti-koppakaa toys along with the artisans of his village. By making excellent quality eti-koppakaa toys C V Raju has brought back the lost glory of these local toys. We can do two things through toys – bring back the glorious past in our lives and also spruce up our golden future. To my start-up friends, to our new entrepreneurs I say- Team up for toys… let us make toys together. For everybody it is the time to get vocal for local toys. Come, let us make some good quality toys for our youth. Toys should be such that in their presence childhood blooms and smiles. Let us make toys which are favourable to the environment too.\n",
            "Friends, similarly in this era of computers and smartphones, there is a big trend of computer games. These games are played by children and grownups as well. But even in these games, their themes are mostly extraneous. Our country has so many ideas, so many concepts; our history has been very rich. Can we make games based on that? I call upon the young talent of the country – make games in India and make games based on India too. It is also said, Let the game begin! So; let us start the game.\n",
            "Friends, be it virtual games, be it the sector of toys in the self-reliant India campaign, all have to play very important role, and therein lies an opportunity too. A hundred years ago when the Non-cooperation movement started, Gandhi ji had written – “Non-cooperation movement is an effort to make countrymen realise their self-respect and their power”.\n",
            "Today, when we are trying to make the country self-reliant, we have to move with full confidence; and make the country self-reliant in every area. A seed that was sown in the form of the Non-cooperation movement, it is now the responsibility of all of us to transform it into banyan tree of self-reliant India.\n",
            "My dear countrymen, everyone acknowledges the capability of Indians to offer innovation and solutions, when there is dedication and sensitivity, this power becomes limitless. At the beginning of this month an app innovation challenge was put before the youth of the country. Our youth participated enthusiastically in this Aatma Nirbhar Bharat App innovation challenge. Around 7 thousand entries were received; of these too, nearly two thirds have been made by the youth of tier two and tier three cities. This is a very auspicious indication for self-reliant India, for future of the country. You will definitely be impressed on seeing the results of the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat App innovation challenge. After a lot of scrutiny, awards have been given to around two dozen Apps in different categories. Do familiarise yourselves with these Apps and connect with them. It is possible that you too get inspired to make something like that. Among these there is an App ‘Kutuki Kids Learning app. This is an interactive app for children in which they can easily learn many aspects of maths and science through songs and stories. In this, there are activities too and games as well. Similarly, there is also an app for micro blogging platform. Its name is ku KOO.. ku. In this we can place our opinion and interact in our mother tongue through text, video or audio. Similarly,Chingari App too is getting popular among the youth. There is an app Ask Sarkar. In this you can interact through chat bot and can get right information about any government scheme – that too through all the three ways- text, audio and video. It can be a great help to you. There is another app called, Step Set Go. This is a fitness app and it keeps a track of how much you walked, how many calories you burnt; it keeps track of the data and also motivates you to stay fit. I have mentioned just a few examples. Many more apps have also won this challenge. There are many business apps and also gaming apps such as Is Equal To, Books & Expense, Zoho Workplace and FTC Talent. Search about them on the Net and you will find a lot of information about these apps. Step forward – innovate some; implement some. Your efforts as today’s small start-ups will transform into big companies tomorrow and become mark of India in the world. And you should not forget that the big companies which exist in the world today, were also, once, start-ups.\n",
            "Dear countrymen, for our children and our students to display their optimum potential, show their mettle; Nutrition and proper nourishment as well play a very big role. The month of September will be observed as Nutrition Month in the entire nation. Nation and Nutriti on are very closely inter-related. We have a maxim – “Yatha Annam Tatha Mannam,” which means our mental and intellectual development is directly related to the quality of our food intake. Experts are of the opinion that the better nutrition a child imbibes in the womb and during childhood, greater is the mental development and he/she remains healthy. It is equally important that for children to be well nourished, the mother also receives proper nourishment. And nutrition merely does not only imply what you eat but also how much you eat and how often you eat. This means whether you are getting essential nutrients. Are you getting Iron, Calcium or not? Sodium or not? Vitamins or not? All these are very important aspects of Nutrition.\n",
            "In this movement pertaining to nutrition, people’s participation is also very crucial. It is public participation that makes it successful. In our country during the past few years, a lot of effort has been made in this direction. Especially in our villages, it is being converted into a mass movement with public participation. Whether it is the nutrition week or the nutrition month, more and more awareness is being generated through these measures. Schools have been integrated. Efforts are being made to ensure competitions for children, attempts are being made to increase awareness too. Just like there is a Class Monitor in the section, there should be a Nutrition Monitor in a similar manner and just like a report card, a Nutrition Card should also be introduced. These are some of the measures that are being initiated. During the course of the Nutrition Month, a food and nutrition quiz will also be organized on the My Gov portal, and there will be a meme competition as well. So do participate and motivate others too. Friends, if you have had the opportunity to visit the Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat, and when it opens after Covid Pandemic ends, you will have the opportunity to visit this spot. A unique kind of nutrition park has been created there. You can witness for yourselves nutrition related education along with fun and frolic.\n",
            "Friends, India is a vast country with a lot of diversity in food and drink. There are six different seasons in our country, different regions produce diverse crops according to the respective climate. Therefore, it is very important that according to the season of a particular region, a well-balanced & nutrient rich, diet plan should be drafted to include  local food grains, fruits and the vegetables cultivated there. Now for example. Millets including coarse grains like Ragi/Finger Millet and Jowar/ Sorghum… these are very beneficial nutritious food. An Agricultural Fund of India is being created, it will have complete information about the crops, that are grown in each district and their related nutritional value. This fund can be of great use for all of you. Come, let us inspire one and all to eat nutritious food and stay healthy during the nutrition month.\n",
            "Dear countrymen, a few weeks ago, while we were celebrating our Independence Day, an interesting news caught my attention. This is the news of two brave hearts of our security forces. One is Sophie and the other Vida. Sophie and Vida are the dogs of the Indian Army who have been awarded the Chief of Army Staff ‘Commendation Cards’. Sophie and Vida received this honour because they performed their duties diligently while protecting their country. Our armed forces and security forces have many such brave dogs who not only live for the country but also sacrifice themselves for the country. Such canines have played a very important role in thwarting numerous bomb blasts and terrorist conspiracies. Some time ago I got to know in great detail about the role of dogs in the security of the country and also got to hear many stories too. One such canine named Balaram sniffed out ammunition on the route of the Amarnath Yatra. Dog, Bhavana searched out IED in 2002. During unearthing the IED, terrorists triggered an explosion and  brave dog were martyred. Two or three years ago in Bijapur Chattisgarh, a sniffer dog Cracker of CRPF also attained martyrdom in an IED blast. You might have seen a very moving scene on TV a few days ago, in which the Beed Police were giving their canine colleague Rocky a final farewell with all due respect. Rocky had helped the police in solving over 300 cases. Dogs also have a significant role in Disaster Management and Rescue Missions. In India, NDRF, the National Disaster Response Force has specially trained dozens of dogs. In the event of an earthquake, building collapse, these dogs are experts in searching out people trapped under debris.\n",
            "Friends, I have also been told that Indian breed dogs are also very good and capable. Among the Indian breeds, Mudhol Hound and Himachali Hound are of excellent pedigree. Rajapalayam, Kanni, Chippiparai and Kombai are fabulous Indian breeds. They cost less to raise and are better adapted to the Indian environment and surroundings. Now, our security agencies are also inducting these Indian breed dogs as part of their security squad. In the recent past, Mudhol Hound dogs have been trained and inducted in the dog squad of the Army, CISF and NSG; Kombai dogs have been included by the CRPF. Research on the Indian breed dogs is also being done by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research with the aim to make them better and more beneficial. Search for these breeds on the internet and know more about them – The beauty and qualities of these breeds will leave you astounded! The next time you think of raising a pet dog, consider bringing home one of these Indian breeds. At a time when Atmanirbhar Bharat is becoming a mantra of the people, how can any domain be left untouched by its influence?\n",
            "My dear countrymen, in a few days from now on September 5th, we will celebrate Teacher’s day. Whenever we think of the successes we have had during the course of our lifetime, we are almost always reminded of one teacher or the other. The fast changing times coupled with the Corona crisis are posing new challenges for our teachers. I am happy that not only have our teachers accepted this challenge but  also turned it into an opportunity. Ways to incorporate more and more technology in studying, ways to imbibe newer tools, ways to help students have been seamlessly embraced by our teachers… they have passed it on to their students as well.  Today, throughout the country, innovation is underway in some field or the other. The students and teachers are collaborating to do something new. I am confident that the way National Education Policy is bringing about a tectonic shift in the nation and that our teachers will play a significant role in disseminating its benefits to our students.\n",
            "Friends, especially my teacher friends, our country will celebrate the festival of the 75th year of independence in the year 2022. Prior to Independence, our country’s war of independence has had a long history. During that period, there wasn’t any corner of the country where revolutionaries for independence did not lay down their lives or sacrificed their all for the country. It is imperative that today’s generation, our students remain familiar with these heroes of our freedom struggle and feel the quintessence – in their own district & area; what transpired during the freedom movement, who laid down their life, who was imprisoned and for how long – When our students are apprised of the history of the freedom struggle viz-a-viz their local surroundings – – only then will we see the reverberations of it on the personality of the student. A lot of work in this direction needs to be done and our teachers shoulder a significant responsibility for it. For example, the district you live in, were there any events during the course of the freedom struggle in the past centuries? This could also become a topic of research for our students. A handwritten log for schools can be prepared… if there is any place in your town associated with the freedom movement, then a visit could also be planned for the students. Students of some schools can also resolve to write 75 poems and theatrical stories on the heroes of our freedom movement to mark the 75th year of our independence. Your efforts will bring to the fore stories of lakhs of unsung heroes – individuals who lived and died for the country but had faded into oblivion. In the 75th year of our independence, it will be a fitting tribute to remember and recognise the efforts of such individuals. With Teachers day to be observed on September 5th, I call upon all our teacher friends to start preparing and join hands to create an environment bringing everyone into its fold.\n",
            "My dear countrymen, the country is on the path of progress on which it has embarked upon and this journey will only be comfortable if each and every citizen is a stakeholder in this process and traveller in this journey. For this to happen, it is imperative that each citizen remains hale & hearty and is part of our collective efforts to overcome Corona.  Safeguarding our health by observing, “Do Gaj Ki Doori, Mask Zaroori” following social distancing norms and ensuring to wear masks will help us defeat corona. I urge you to follow these guidelines and I pray for your good health. Stay healthy and stay happy, with these wishes, we will meet again in the next edition of Mann Ki Baat.\n",
            "Many many thanks.\n",

            "I could sense and see the enthusiasm, jubilation and confidence, in the preparations by the students, during my conversation with them. I am confident that there will be more facilities available after the construction of the new building. The students will be inspired and encouraged to do more with these facilities.\n",
            "Friends, once Rani Lakshmi Bai had roared from the land of Bundelkhand: \"I will not give my Jhansi\". We all remember this sentence \"I will not give my Jhansi\". Today there is a need for a new roar and from Jhansi, from the land of Bundelkhand. 'My Jhansi-My Bundelkhand' will put all the power at its disposal and will write a new chapter to make self-reliant India campaign a success.\n",
            "Agriculture has a very big role in it. When we talk about self-reliance in agriculture, it is not restricted to food grains only, but it is about the self-reliance of the entire economy of villages. The mission is to add value to the produce cultivated in different parts of the country and take them to the markets of the world. The purpose behind self-reliance in agriculture is to make farmers not only producers but entrepreneurs as well. There will be huge opportunities for jobs and self-employment at a large scale in villages and nearby areas when farmers and agriculture will progress like industries.\n",
            "Friends, the government has been continuously taking several historic reforms in the field of agriculture with this resolution in mind. In India, there has been a huge improvement in the legal laws which had shackled the farmers, the mandi (market) laws and the Essential Services Act. Like any other industry, the farmer will be able to sell his produce anywhere in the country where he gets better price.\n",
            "Besides, a comprehensive plan has been made to develop clusters of industries near villages. A special fund with one lakh crore rupees has been created so that these industries get better infrastructure facilities. The fund will help our Farmer Producers' Organizations (FPOs) to prepare modern infrastructure for storage and establish processing-related industries. This will create new opportunities for the youth studying in the field of agriculture and their other friends and there will be new avenues for start-ups.\n",
            "Friends, work is in progress to connect everything from seeds to markets with technology and modern research. Research institutions and agricultural universities have a big role in it. Just six years ago, there was only one central agricultural university in the country. Today, three central agricultural universities are operational in the country. Other than this, three more national institutions - IARI-Jharkhand, IARI-Assam and Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Integrated Farming in Bihar’s Motihari are being established. These research institutions will not only provide opportunities to students, but will also extend technology gains to local farmers and help increase their capacity.\n",
            "Alongside, work is also going on in several spheres in the country which includes solar pump, solar tree, development of seeds according to local demands, micro irrigation, drip irrigation, etc. You all have an important part in making these initiatives accessible to a large number of farmers, particularly to the farmers of Bundelkhand. Another example has been seen recently when modern technology was used to tackle agriculture and its associated challenges.\n",
            "You may recall there was a huge attack by locusts in the month of May in Bundelkhand. The farmer is not able to sleep when there is news of swarms of locusts, for those destroying months of efforts. The damage to crops and vegetables of farmers becomes certain. I have been told that Bundelkhand was attacked by locusts after almost 30 years. Otherwise, locusts never used to come here.\n",
            "Friends, not only Uttar Pradesh, but more than 10 states of the country were affected by the locust attacks. It was very difficult to control its spread through normal and traditional methods. India was liberated from these swarms and saved from these huge attacks in a very scientific way. Had India not been suffering from Corona, there would have been positive discussion on it in the Indian media for a week, that such a great work has happened.\n",
            "In order to save farmers' crops from locust attacks, efforts were made on war footing. Dozens of control rooms were set up in several towns, including Jhansi. Arrangements were made so that information could reach farmers at the earliest. We did not even have special spray machines in large numbers to kill and ward off locusts, because these attacks usually occurred. The government bought dozens of these modern machines immediately and sent them to districts. We deployed all the resources, be it tankers, vehicles, chemicals or medicines so that the farmers did not have to suffer much.\n",
            "Dozens of drones were deployed to spray chemicals in large areas to save big trees. Even helicopters were used to spray chemicals. It is because of all these efforts that India could save farmers from huge losses.\n",
            "Friends, the young researchers and scientists will have to work continuously on a One Life One mission so that there is maximum use of drone technology, artificial intelligence technology and modern farm equipment in the country’s agriculture.\n",
            "For the last six years, concerted efforts are being made to link research with farming and availability of scientific advice to small farmers at village levels. It is necessary to make this ecosystem of experts from campus to field more effective. Your university also has a very large role in it.\n",
            "Friends, it is also necessary to take education related to agriculture and its practical application to schools. Efforts are being made to introduce the subject of agriculture at the middle school level in villages. There will be two advantages from this. One advantage will be that the natural understanding associated with farming in children of the village will be expanded. The second advantage will be that they will be able to give more information to their families about farming and related technology, trade and business. It will also encourage Agro Enterprise in the country. Necessary reforms have been proposed in the new National Education Policy.\n",
            "Not only since the times of Lakshmi Bai, Bundelkhand has always been leading from the front in tackling challenges. This has been the identity of Bundelkhand to face any challenges.\n",
            "The people of Bundelkhand are also determined against Corona. The government has also made efforts so that people have minimum difficulties. In order to ensure that the stove of the poor keeps burning, free ration is being provided to crores of poor and rural families in Uttar Pradesh, just like it is being provided in other parts of the country. Almost 10 lakh poor sisters of Bundelkhand have been provided with free gas cylinders. Crores of rupees have been deposited in the Jan Dhan accounts of lakhs of sisters. Over 700 crore rupees have been spent in Uttar Pradesh alone under the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan. It is ensuring employment to lakhs of workers. I have been told that hundreds of ponds have been repaired and new ponds have been constructed in Bundelkhand.\n",
            "Friends, when I came to Jhansi, ahead of the election, I had told the sisters of Bundelkhand that the previous five years were for toilets and the next five years would be for water. It is due to the blessings of the sisters that the campaign to make available drinking water to homes of all is moving very fast. The work of building water sources and laying pipelines continues unabated in all the districts of Bundelkhand, spread over UP and MP. About 500 water projects worth over 10,000 crore rupees have been sanctioned in this region. In the last two months, work on projects worth about 3,000 crore rupees has also commenced. Lakhs of families of Bundelkhand will get direct benefit once these projects are ready. In order to increase the water table in Bundelkhand, work is in progress on Atal Bhujal Yojana. A plan of more than 700 crore rupees is underway to improve the water level in hundreds of villages in Jhansi, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Chitrakoot and Lalitpur.\n",
            "Friends, Betwa flows on one side of Bundelkhand and the Ken River on the other. Mother Yamuna is in the north direction, but the situation is such that the benefits of these rivers passes accrue to the entire region. The government has been working continuously to change this situation. The Ken-Betwa River Link project will change the fate of this region. We are in constant touch with the governments of both the states and working in this direction. I have full confidence that the life of Bundelkhand will change forever once it gets adequate water.\n",
            "Whether it is the Bundelkhand Expressway or the Defense Corridor, projects worth thousands of crores of rupees will create new employment opportunities. Day is not far when this land of the braves, Jhansi and nearby area will be developed in a big way to make the country self-reliant in defense. In a way, the ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and Jai Vigyan’ mantra will echo in the four directions. The central government and Uttar Pradesh government are committed to enriching the ancient identity of Bundelkhand and the pride of this land.\n",
            "With best wishes for the future, many many congratulations to all of you for this new building of the university.\n",
            "Always remember this mantra, distance of two yards and the mask is must. If you remain safe, the country will be safe.\n",
            "Many many thanks to all of you!\n",
            "Thanks!\n",

            "https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/pms-address-at-seminar-on-atmanirbhar-bharat-in-defence-manufacturing/?tag_term=pmspeech&comment=disable My cabinet colleague, Shri Rajnath ji, Chief of Defense Staff General Bipin Rawat ji, Chiefs of the three wings of the military, all senior officers of Government of India and friends in the industry. Namaskar.\n",
            "I am very happy that all the important stakeholders associated with India’s defense production are present here. I congratulate Defense Minister Rajnathji and his entire team for organizing this seminar. The outcome of the brainstorming session will give a fillip to our efforts for self-reliance in the field of defense sector. The suggestions that you have given at this collective brainstorming session will be very useful in the coming days.\n",
            "It also gives me pleasure that Defense Minister Rajnathji is determined on a mission mode. I have full faith that his relentless efforts will lead to very good results.\n",
            "Friends, it is not hidden from anyone that India has been one of the main defense importers in the world for the last several years. When India became independent, it had huge capabilities in defense production. There was a well-established 100-year-old ecosystem in defense production in India. Not many countries had the resources and potential of India. But it is unfortunate that not much attention was paid on this issue for several decades. In a way, it became a routine exercise. No serious attempts were made. And several countries which started much after us have raced ahead of us in the last 50 years. But, the situation is changing now.\n",
            "In the last few years, you must have experienced that we have been making concerted efforts to unshackle all the fetters in this sector. Our aim is to increase manufacturing, development of new technologies in India and the maximum growth of the private sector in this particular field. Therefore, several steps have been taken which include reforms in the licensing procedure, creation of level-playing fields, simplification of export process, reforms in offset provisions, etc.\n",
            "Friends, I believe that of all these steps, what is more important is the new mindset in the country regarding the defense sector. We can feel it, there is birth of a new mindset. The spirit of self-confidence in the defense sector is paramount for making a modern and self-reliant India. For long, the country was debating the appointment of Chief of Defense Staff, but no decision could be taken. This decision is the symbol of the self-confidence of a new India.\n",
            "There was no permission for foreign direct investment in the defense production for a long time. The government of revered Atalji took the first initiative. More reforms were carried out after our government came to power. Doors are being opened for 74% automatic FDI in this sector for the first time. This is the outcome of the self-confidence of a new India.\n",
            "For decades, ordnance factories were being run like government departments. Not only the country had to suffer because of the limited vision, the people who were working there, who had talent and commitment, who were hardworking, our hard and experienced labor class, suffered a lot.\n",
            "The ecosystem of the sector, which could create job opportunities for crores of people, remained very limited. Now, we are moving in the direction of corporatization of ordnance factories. Both the workers and the military will get a push. This is the proof of self-confidence of a new India.\n",
            "Friends, our commitment towards self-reliance in defense production is not limited to discussions or on papers. Several concrete steps have been taken for its implementation. The creation of CDS has improved the coordination for procurement among all the three wings of the military, and it is helping scale up the purchases of defense equipment. In the coming days, the size of the orders is going to increase for the domestic industry. In order to ensure this, one part of the Defense Ministry's capital budget has been earmarked for the equipment to be made in India.\n",
            "You must have seen that recently 101 defense items have been completely protected for domestic purchases. In the coming days, this list will be made more comprehensive and many items will be added to it. The aim of this list is not to restrict imports only, but this step has been taken to encourage industries in India. The spirit of the government and the future prospects have been presented before all of you friends, in black and white, be it the private sector, public sector, MSME, or startups.\n",
            "Simultaneously, we are working to speed up the process of procurement, streamline the testing mechanism and rationalize the quality requirements. And I am happy that these efforts have the cooperation from all the three wings of the military in a very coordinated way. In a way, it is a pro-active role.\n",
            "Friends, technology upgrade is a must for self-reliance in modern equipment. There is a need to make next generation products. In order to achieve this, besides DRDO, the private sector, research and innovation in academic institutions is also being encouraged. Emphasis is being given on the co-production model through joint ventures with foreign partners instead of the technology transfer facility. Now, our foreign partners have the best option to launch production in India in keeping with the size of our market.\n",
            "Friends, our government has worked on the mantra of reform, perform and transform from the beginning. Our effort has been to reduce red tapism and lay red carpet. The entire world has seen the reforms that have taken place in the ease of doing business since 2014. We have carried out reforms in intellectual property, taxation, insolvency and bankruptcy and also in space and atomic energy which are considered to be very difficult and complex . And now you are fully aware about the series of reforms in labor laws, and it is an ongoing process.\n",
            "Till a few years ago, no thought was given on these topics. And today, these reforms have become practical. The process of reforms will not stop here; we are going to move ahead. Therefore, no stopping and no tiring. Neither I nor you have to tire. We have to keep marching ahead. From our side, I tell you this is our commitment.\n",
            "Friends, as far as infrastructure is concerned, the work on the defense corridors is happening at a lightning speed. The state-of-the-art infrastructure is being developed in collaboration with the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. We have set aside an investment target worth 20,000 crore rupees for the next five years. We are getting good results from IDEX which was initiated to encourage entrepreneurs associated with MSME and start-ups. More than 50 start-ups have developed technology and products for the use of the armed forces through this platform.\n",
            "Friends, I want to make another thing very clear before you. Our resolution for a self-reliant India is not inward looking. The idea behind making a strong India is to make the global economy more resilient and stable, and for the global peace. The same spirit is behind self-reliance in defense manufacturing. India has the capability to become a trusted supplier of defense products for several friendly countries. This will give a new momentum to India’s strategic partnership and India’s role will also be strengthened as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region.\n",
            "Friends, the government’s efforts and commitment are in front of you. Together, we have to demonstrate our resolve for self-reliant India. A self-reliant India is a win-win resolve for everybody, be it the private sector or the public sector, or our foreign partners. Our government is committed to provide you with a better ecosystem.\n",
            "The suggestions that have been offered by you are going to be very useful. I have been told that the draft of the defense production and export promotion policy has been shared with all the stakeholders. Your feedback will help in early implementation of this policy. It is also necessary that the seminar should not be a one-time event; there should be more such seminars in future. There should be an intrinsic culture of continuous discussion and feedback between the industry and the government.\n",
            "I believe that our resolutions will materialize with these collective efforts. I once again thank you for taking your time out to gather here with self-confidence to make a self-reliant India. I believe we all will discharge our responsibilities in a much better way to realize this resolve.\n",
            "Once again, I extend my many many best wishes to you.\n",
            "Many many thanks.\n",

            "Congratulations and many best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of independence.\n",
            "Today, we are able to live in an independent India because of the sacrifices of millions of sons and daughters of Mother India. This is an occasion to pay tribute to the freedom fighters, martyrs and brave souls and their spirit and dedication to free Mother India.\n",
            "The valiant soldiers of our armed forces, our paramilitary forces, our police personnel and our security forces- everyone is engaged in protecting Mother India. They are engaged in safeguarding the common man. Today is the day to remember their sacrifices and penance sincerely and wholeheartedly.\n",
            "There is another name: Aurobindo Ghose. Today is the birth anniversary of Aurobindo Ghose, who tread the path from being a revolutionary to spirituality. Let us seek his blessings so that we can fulfil his as well as our vision.\n",
            "We are passing through an extraordinary situation. Today, children- the bright future of India- are not in front of me. Why? It is because Corona has stopped everyone. In this period of corona, I salute millions of corona warriors- doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, ambulance drivers and so on-who all should I count.\n",
            "I salute all the corona warriors, who for a long time have adhered to the mantra of ‘सेवा परमो धर्म’ i.e. service is the best religion and have served the children of Mother India with complete dedication.\n",
            "In the period of corona, many of our brothers and sisters have been affected by this pandemic; many families have been affected; many have also lost their lives. I express my condolences to all such families, and I believe the indomitable will power and determination of 130 crore countrymen will make us win over Corona and we shall definitely win.\n",
            "I know that recently we have been passing through a number of crises. Floods, especially in the north-east, eastern India, south India and some parts of western India; landslides in many areas; people have had to face many problems. Many people have lost their lives. I also express my condolences to those families.\n",
            "And the nation stands in solidarity with the state governments in these days of crisis. No stone is being left unturned by either the state or central government to provide relief measures to the needy.\n",
            "My dear Countrymen, Independence Day is a festival to celebrate freedom. It is an occasion to enthuse new energy by remembering our freedom fighters. This day is a harbinger of new inspirations. It reignites new fervour, exuberance and enthusiasm. And in times like now, it becomes even more imperative for us to be determined. It is an auspicious day because when we meet again next year to celebrate, we shall be entering into the 75 years of our free existence. This is a momentous occasion. Today, all of us 130 crores Indians have to make significant pledges for the coming two years. And when we complete the 75 years of our freedom, we will be able celebrate the redemption of those pledges .\n",
            "My dear countrymen, our forefathers fought for this freedom with extreme commitment, utmost integrity, sincere penance, renunciation and sacrifice; we should never forget the way they laid their lives for Mother India. We should never forget that during this long and dark ages of slavery, not even a moment was lost when they were not moved by the desire for freedom. There insn’t a countryman who did not put his best foot forward aspiring to break free the nation from the shackles of slavery, by waging a war and making any sacrifice possible to bring this day. Many sacrificed their youth in jails. Many left behind their life’s dreams and embraced the gallows. I salute these revered martyrs who offered themselves as an oblation. Indeed amazing! On the one side, the country witnessed a phase of mass movements and on the other side the resounding voice of armed revolt.\n",
            "Under the leadership of Pujya Bapu, the great national awakening accompanied by mass movements, gave new impetus to the struggle for freedom. And so today we are blessed to be able to celebrate our Independence Day with such fervour.\n",
            "During this freedom struggle, several efforts were made to douse the fire of revolt and throttle the soul and spirit of our motherland. Many attempts were made to ruin the Indian culture, tradition, customs and heritage. Running across centuries, that was the period of SAAM DAAM DAND BHED (either by hook or crook) – and all this was at its peak. Many came here with the innate belief that they have come to reign the world for eternity (yaavat chandra diwakaro-till sun and moon exist). But the strong determination to be freed beat such ambitions to dust. They believed that India was a divided lot due to the existence of multiple identities, nobilities, languages and dialects, cuisines, costumes and culture. They labored under the misunderstanding that a country of so many diversities can never stand up as one against any force. But they could not recognize the soul and pulse of the country, that life force, that chord which binds us together. And when this force came out with full vigour in the fight for freedom, India succeeded in throwing away the shackles of slavery .\n",
            "We are aware of the fact that that was the regime when propagators of expansionism spread across geographies and attained supremacy and power, but the freedom movement of India inspired many across the globe to stand against these forces. India became a pillar and ignited the fire of freedom struggle all over the world.\n",
            "And those, who were involved in the blind race of expansionism, threw the World into two World wars, destroyed humanity, ruined lives and wrecked the globe to achieve their designs.\n",
            "But even during such a period, even in the midst of the destructive war, India did not abandon its urge for freedom; neither was it found lacking, nor did it lower its guard.\n",
            "Whenever there was a need, the country has been making sacrifices, enduring sufferings and leading people’s movements. India’s battle created an atmosphere for freedom in the world. And the change that the power of India brought in the world, it became a challenge for expansionism. History can never deny it.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "In the entire World, in its war for independence,  India kept marching with its head high with its strength of unity, collectivity, the resolve for its bright future, its commitment and inspiration.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "In the midst of the Corona pandemic, 130 crore Indians pledged themselves to become self-reliant. Today self-reliance is etched in the mind of every Indian. We are also witnessing the realization of that dream of Self-Reliant India (“AatmaNirbharBharat”).  “Self-reliant India” is not just a word, it has become a mantra for 130 crore countrymen.\n",
            "When I talk of self-reliance, all of us who are now above the age group of 25-30 years surely recall how we were goaded by our parents and elders to become self-reliant as we attained an age of 20 – 21. Every family expects its children of 20-21 years to be self-reliant. As we are just one step away from the 75th Anniversary of Independence, it is essential for a country like India to stand own its own, and to become self reliant. What is necessary for a family is also essential for a country. I have full faith that India will realize this dream. And the reason for this is the strength of my country’s citizens in which I have full faith, I am proud of their talent, I have confidence in our youth and the country’s unparalleled women power. I have faith in the thinking, in the approach of India. And history is witness that whenever India resolves to do something, it does it.\n",
            "Therefore, when we talk about self-reliance, it arouses not only curiosity all over the World but also expectations from India. Therefore, it is imperative that we make ourselves capable for realization of that expectation. It is very essential to prepare ourselves.\n",
            "A large country like India is full of energy of youth power. The first condition for a self-reliant India is self-confidence which is the foundation of self-reliance.\n",
            "And this has the power to give a new vision and a new energy to development.\n",
            "India has always followed the adage – ‘Whole world is one family’. Veda says ‘वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्’ and Vinoba ji used to say ‘‘जय जगत’ i.e. hail the world. Therefore, the world is one family for us. So, alongside financial development, mankind and humanity should also get importance. And we follow this dictum.       \n",
            "Today the world is interconnected and inter-dependent. So, it is the need of the hour that a vast country like India should increase its contribution to the world economy. It is also India’s duty towards world welfare. If India wants to increase its contribution then she herself will have to be empowered; she will have to be self-reliant or ‘AatmaNirbhar’. We must make ourselves capable of contributing towards world welfare. If our roots are strong and we are capable enough, we will be able to take steps towards world welfare.\n",
            "Our country has plenty of natural resources. It is the need of the hour that we start the value addition of these natural resources and human resources; and to take the country to new heights. How long shall we continue to export raw material to the world? How long will the process of exporting raw material and importing finished goods continue? So, we will have to be self-reliant. We will have to resort to value addition of our capabilities as per the world’s requirements. It is our responsibility. We want to move ahead in the field of value addition to contribute to world welfare. Similarly, there was a time when we used to import wheat from abroad; but our farmers have done a wonderful job. And now India is self-reliant in the agricultural sector. Today India’s farmers not only supply the food grains for the citizens of India but India is also in such a position that it provides food grains to the other countries in need.\n",
            "Though this is our strength- the strength of self-reliance in agriculture- value addition is also necessary in this sector. Our farm sector needs to evolve in line with requirements of world; Value addition is required for our farm sector\n",
            "Today, the country is taking several new initiatives. You see, we have opened up the space sector. The youth of the country is getting opportunities. We have liberated the agriculture sector from the shackles of laws and have tried to make it self-reliant. When India becomes powerful in the space sector, neighbouring countries also get its benefits. If we become powerful in the energy sector, India can help those countries that want to dispel their darkness. When the country’s health infrastructure becomes self-reliant, then India becomes a preferred country as a destination for health tourism. Therefore, it is necessary to see to it that ‘Make in India’ products get appreciated in the world. History is a witness to the fact that there was a time when the products made in our country by our skilled manpower were used to get appreciated all over the world.\n",
            "When we talk about becoming self-reliant, then we do not merely refer to decreasing the import demands. When we talk of self-reliance, it is about our skills, our human resources. When we start sourcing things from abroad, then our capabilities start depleting and consequently, it gets completely destroyed over generations. We need to preserve it and enhance that caliber of ours. We need to accentuate our skills, our creativity and with that we need to touch new heights. We need to strengthen skill development for a self-reliant India, for improving our competency.\n",
            "My dear citizens, I know that when I talk about becoming self-reliant then people raise several doubts. I do accept that there are millions of challenges while we travel on the path of becoming self-reliant and these challenges increase further in a competitive world. We should realise that for the millions of challenges we face, our nation has the capability to provide billions of solutions. My countrymen are there with the capability to resolve the issues.\n",
            "You can see that in the challenging times of Corona, we were in need of many items which we needed to import but the world was unable to provide them. The youth of our nation, our entrepreneurs, the industry accepted the challenge. The nation that never manufactured N-95, started doing so. We started production of PPE which was not being produced before, similarly we started producing ventilators in India, which were not being made here before. We are not only able to meet our own requirements, but now also become strong enough to export to the world. We can very well see how a self-reliant India can help the world. Therefore it is also the duty of India to work for the welfare of the world.\n",
            "Enough is enough. What should be the mind-set of independent India? The mind-set of independent India should be ‘Vocal for Local’. We should take pride in our local products. If we do not praise and support our indigenous products, then how will they get an opportunity to flourish and improve, how will they gain strength? Come, let’s pledge that as we move towards the 75th year of our independence, we shall adopt the talisman of ‘Vocal for Local’ and together let’s strengthen ourselves.\n",
            "My dear Countrymen, we have clearly seen how our nation can do wonders, how it progresses. Who could have imagined that lakhs and crores of money would be directly transferred to the Jan-Dhan accounts of the poor? Who could have imagined that so many changes would be made in the APMC Act for the welfare of farmers? Who could have thought that the farmers who were living under the Damocles’ sword of the Essential Commodities Act, would be freed of it after so many years? Could we have imagined that the space sector would be laid open for the youth of our nation? Today we are witnessing that National Education Policy, One Nation-One Ration Card, One Nation-One Grid, One Nation-One Tax, Insolvency and Bank Bankruptcy Code and the effort for merger of banks- all these things have become the reality of nation, fact for our nation.\n",
            "The world is looking at the outcomes of the reforms that are taking place in India in these times. The world is closely observing the reforms we are bringing one after another, one linked to another. As a result of this Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India has broken all its previous records last year.\n",
            "Last year, there has been an 18% increase in FDI in India. So, even during the corona pandemic, top companies of the world are turning to India. This confidence hasn’t been created just like that. The world didn’t get fascinated with India without a reason. This confidence has grown because of the hard work put in by India in the field of its policies, democracy and strengthening the foundation of its economy.\n",
            "Today many businesses of the world are viewing India as the hub of the supply chain. So now, we have to move ahead with the mantra of ‘Make for World’ alongside ‘Make in India’.\n",
            "Try to recall what happened recently and take pride in the capabilities of 130 crore countrymen. During this corona pandemic, there were cyclones in the east and the west coasts of India, umpteen number of people died because of lightning & landslides, and earthquakes of small intensity were felt time and again. As if these were not enough, swarms of locust created havoc for our farmers. A series of adversities struck one after another. Yet, the country didn’t lose confidence and continued to move forward with self-confidence.\n",
            "Today, it is our priority to pull the people and the economy of our country out of this corona pandemic. The National Infrastructure Pipeline Project will play an important role in this endeavour. Rs 110 lakh crore will be spent on this project. For this, about seven thousand projects have been identified in different sectors. This will also give a new direction and a fresh momentum to the overall infrastructure development of the country. It is often said that during crises, the emphasis should be given on infrastructure so that economic activity is speeded up and people get employment and it generates a cascading effect. Both small and large enterprises, farmers and the middle class benefit to a great extent.\n",
            "And I want to recall one incident today. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, he had started a programme with far-reaching impact called the Golden Quadrilateral. He had taken the road network infrastructure to the next generation level. Even today, the country looks at the ‘golden quadrilateral’ with pride and feels yes, our country is transforming.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "Atal ji had done this work in his time but now we have to carry it forward. We must give it a new thrust. We cannot work in silos. We do not need a situation where in the infrastructure sector, road sector will work only for roads and the rail sector will work only for rail. There is no coordination between the railways and the roadways, between the airport and the port, between the railway station and the bus station– this sort of situation is not desirable. We must ensure that the infrastructure is a comprehensive and an integrated one. It should be complementary to each other. The rail should be complementary to the road, the road to sea port and the sea port to the airport. We are moving towards a multi-modal connectivity infrastructure for the new century. And this will give a new dimension. We have started the work with a great dream. And I believe that by eliminating silos, we will give a new strength to all these systems.\n",
            "Along with this, our coastline has a very important significance in the world trade. While moving on with Port led development, in the coming days, we will focus on working towards building a modern state-of-art infrastructure towards the construction of four lane road across the entire coastline.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "Our scriptures said something very profound. It is said in our scriptures that- ‘Samarthya mulam Swatantryam, Shram mulam Vaibhavam’ means ‘Capability is the source of freedom, and labour force is the source  of grandeur,  prosperity and progress of any nation.\n",
            "Therefore, nothing can match the hard work of the common man, be it cities or villages. When a toiling society gets amenities, the struggles of life ease, everyday troubles are reduced and this helps in boosting their energy paying rich dividends.\n",
            "In the last six years, several campaigns have been launched to improve the lives of the toiling citizens of the country be it about their own bank accounts,  owning a pucca house, construction of such a large number of toilets, providing electricity connection in every house, providing a gas connection to free our mothers and sisters from the smoke, making efforts to provide insurance protection to the poorest of the poor,   Ayushman Bharat Yojna to provide free treatment of upto five lakh rupees in the best of hospitals, connecting Ration shops through digital technology. A significant progress was made  in the last six years to reinstate transparency and remove discriminatory practices so that facilities reach every poor person.\n",
            "These instruments have also helped a lot in delivering the services seamlessly during the Corona crisis. During this period, we continued to provide free gas cylinders to crores of poor families, irrespective of whether they had ration card or not the kitchen flames of more than 80 crores of my countrymen were kept alighted by supplying free food grains to the  80 crores countrymen; approximately 90 thousand crore rupees were transferred directly into the bank accounts. Just a few years ago, this would have been unimaginable that all hundred paise of a rupee disbursed from Delhi would reach the account of the poor. It was indeed beyond one’s imagination hitherto.\n",
            "Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan has been launched to generate employment in their own villages. We trust that our worker friends will be re-skilling and upskilling themselves. Having full faith in their efforts, relying on the skilled manpower, relying on rural and indigenous resources, we gave a clarion call “vocal for local” and “re-skill and up-skill” in an endeavor to empower our poor and our country’s labour force.\n",
            "Since the center of economic activity is the city, a scheme is being implemented for workers like street vendors etc who come from off villages to the cities for their livelihood, for providing finances directly by the banks. Lakhs  of people have taken advantage of this in such a short span of time even during the period of the Corona crisis. Now they  do not need to borrow money  at high interest. The workers can now get their money with dignity and authority.\n",
            "In the same way, when our workers migrate to the city, if they get good accommodation then their efficiency also increases. And keeping this in mind, we have formulated a major scheme for arranging affordable housing for them inside the city, so that when the workers come to the city, they can focus, deliver and progress with full faith and commitment.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "This is also true and we have seen that there are some segments of the society which get left behind, are not able to come out of poverty in the country’s march towards development, Similarly, there are some areas, places, terrains which get left behind. Balanced development is very much necessary to make India self-reliant. We have identified more than 110 aspiring districts which are lagging behind compared to an  average district. We have to bring each and every parameter of those districts at par with the country’s average. We are making every effort so that people of these 110 districts, which are lagging behind, have access to better education, better health facilities and have opportunities for local employment.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "The priority of a self-reliant India is a self-reliant farming sector and self-reliant farmers. And we cannot ignore them. We have seen the condition of farmers. Various reforms have been undertaken since independence. We have to free them of all the shackles and we have done that.\n",
            "You can’t even imagine this. If you make soap, fabric or sugar in one corner you can sell it in any part of the country. But not many people know that our farmers could not sell their produce anywhere in the country and according to their will. He had to sell his produce at a notified area. We have eliminated all those restrictions.\n",
            "Now India’s farmer will be able to breathe free by selling his produce in any part of the country or the world according to his own terms. We have emphasized on several alternative measures to increase the income of the farmer. We are constantly working to reduce the input cost of the farming. How can he be provided a solar pump instead of a diesel pump, how can the producer of food become an energy producer? We are working in a direction so that avenues like bee farming, fisheries, poultry, etc should be made available to him so that his income gets doubled.\n",
            "Time demands that our agriculture sector becomes modern and there should be value addition, there should be food processing, food packaging. And it needs better infrastructure.\n",
            "You must have seen that the Indian government has sanctioned 1,00,000 crore rupees for agriculture infrastructure even during the Corona pandemic. This infrastructure will be for the welfare of the farmers and they will be able to get better prices of their produce, and will be able to sell their produce in foreign markets. They will have greater reach to foreign markets.\n",
            "There is a need to strengthen rural industries. Special economic zones will be created in the rural areas. A web of agriculture and non-agriculture industries will be created. We have tried to create FPO (Farmer Product Association) which will go a long way in their economic empowerment.\n",
            "Brothers and sisters,\n",
            "Last time, I had made an announcement for the Jal Jeevan Mission. It is completing one year. I am very proud to tell you that our dream of making available pure drinking water to all the people is getting realized. The solution to several health problems is directly linked to the pure drinking water. It also contributes to that nation’s economy. That’s why we have started the Jal Jeevan Mission.\n",
            "Today, I am happy to say  that everyday we are able to supply piped-water to over one lakh houses. And in the last one year, we have been able to provide water to 2 crore families, especially to the tribals living in the forests and far-flung areas. A huge campaign has been run. And I am glad that today ‘Jal-Jeevan Mission’ has created an environment of healthy competition in the country. There is a healthy competition among the districts, among the cities and also among the states. Everyone is hoping that the Prime Minister’s dream of ‘Jal-Jeevan Mission’ is accomplished at the earliest in their respective areas. The new strength of Cooperative and Competitive Federalism has been associated with the ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’ and we are moving forward with it.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "Whether it is the  agriculture sector, the small scale industries sector or the people in services sector, almost all these people, in a way  constitute a huge middle class of India. The professionals from the middle class have made a name for themselves in the world today. Our doctors, engineers, lawyers, scientists, from the middle class have made a mark in the world. Therefore, it is true that whatever opportunities that the middle class gets, they make the most out of it and therefore the middle class needs freedom from government interference. The middle class must get more new opportunities and an open environment, and our government is constantly working to fulfil these dreams of the middle class. The middle class has the power to do miracles. So the middle class families get the greatest benefits of Ease of living. Cheap internet, affordable smartphones or cheap flight tickets under UDAN scheme  or our highways or Information ways – all these things are going to increase the strength of the middle class. Today you must have seen that the prime dream of the middle class person who has come out of poverty, is to have a home; he wants an equal life. We have done a lot of work in the field of EMI in the country and as a result, the Home Loan rates have become cheaper. When someone takes a home loan, one can get a rebate of about 6 lakh rupees, by the time the loan is repaid. Recently, it was noticed that a lot of affected middle-class families have invested their money (to buy a house), but could not get the possession of the  house due to lack of completion of the schemes and they were still living in a rented house. The Government of India has set up a special fund of 25 thousand crores rupees to complete the incomplete houses to ensure that middle class families get homes.\n",
            "The rates of GST and the income tax have come down. Today, with these minimum establishment facilities, we are trying to take the country forward. Bringing co-operative banks under the ambit of RBI, in itself is a guarantee for safety of the money of middle class families.\n",
            "The reforms undertaken in the MSME sector and the agriculture sector, will directly benefit these hard-working middle class families. Consequently, our businessmen and small entrepreneurs will get the benefits of the special fund of thousands of crores of rupees. The strength and energy of the common Indian is the big foundation of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. Relentless work is going on at every level to maintain this strength.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "Education of the country is of great importance in building a self-reliant, modern, New India, an India which will be prosperous and happy. With this thought, we have become successful today in providing the country with a new National Education Policy after three decades.\n",
            "Every nook and corner of India is welcoming it with renewed enthusiasm and a new vigour.. And this is the National Education Policy, which will connect our students with the roots. Alongside, it will help them become global citizens. The students will be well-rooted and still touching new heights.\n",
            "You must have noticed that a special stress has been laid in National Education Policy on National Research Foundation because in order to progress, the nation needs to innovate. Higher the stress that will be laid on innovation and research, greater would be the strength to take India forward in this competitive world.\n",
            "Who would have thought that there would be online classes in rural areas and such a momentum would be created so fast? Sometimes, in the times of adversity, new revolutionary initiatives emerge with force. That’s the reason we have witnessed how in this pandemic situation, a culture of online classes has emerged.\n",
            "You can see how fast the online digital transactions are increasing. Look at BHIM UPI app…. Anyone would be immensely proud to know that we could make transactions of Rs 3 Lakh Crore in the last month alone through BHIM UPI.. This is an excellent example of how we have accepted the changing scenarios.\n",
            "If you see, prior to 2014, only 5 dozen panchayats had the optical fiber network. However in the last 5 years, 1.5 lakh panchayats are connected with the optical fiber network which is helping us today, immensely. We are working on the goal of taking it to every panchayat and this work is in progress in the remaining one lakh panchayats. In these changing times it is essential that Rural India is also brought under the ambit of Digital India. There is a surge in the demand of online facilities among the rural population. Keeping this in view, we had earlier proposed the extension of connectivity to every panchayat and today I would like to assure you that we have decided that we will connect all our six lakh villages, with the optical fiber network. As the requirements have changed, so have our priorities. In over six lakh villages, thousands and lakhs of kilometers of optical fiber would be laid down. We have decided that within 1000 days, we will complete the work of connecting over six lakhs villages with optical fiber.\n",
            "In this era of technology, our dependence on cyberspace is going to increase multifold. However, cyberspace offers its own risks and threats. The world is very well aware of these. It can be a threat to the social fabric of our country, our economy and can even threaten the development of our nation; we are very well-aware of that. India is very cautious and is planning to take steps to combat these risks. Not only this, new systems are continuously being developed. In a short span of time, a draft of new cyber security policy would be presented to the nation. In the coming times, we will have to integrate everything and then work within the framework of this cyber security. We will formulate strategies to move forth.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "Whenever opportunities were given to women power in India, they have brought glory to the country and have strengthened the country. Today the country is committed to providing equal opportunities for employment and self-employment to women. Today women in India are working in underground coal mines. Today, the daughters of my country are also flying the fighter planes and touching the skies. Today India is among those countries of the world where women are being included in the combat role in the Navy and the Air Force. We have taken the decision of providing 6 months paid leave to pregnant women, liberating our Muslim sisters and women of our country from the suffering of triple talaq and the economic empowerment of women.\n",
            "Out of the 40 crore Jan Dhan accounts, 22 crore accounts belong to our sisters. During the Corona period, about  30 thousand crore rupees have been deposited into the accounts of these sisters. Around 25 crore MUDRA loans have been given, in which 70% of the loans have been given to our mothers and sisters. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, maximum registration is also being done in the names of women.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "This government has also been persistently concerned about the better healthcare for poor sisters and daughters. We have done a huge job to providing sanitary pads at one rupee each in Janaushadhi Kendra. In a short span of time, more than 5 crore sanitary pads have been delivered to these poor women from 6000 Janaushadhi Kendras.\n",
            "We have formed a committee to ensure that the daughters are no longer suffering from malnutrition and they are married off at the right age. As soon as the report is submitted, appropriate decisions will be taken about the age of marriage of daughters.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "It is very natural that health sector draws attention in this period of Corona pandemic. As such, the biggest lesson of self-reliance has been taught to us by the Health Sector during this crisis. And to achieve that goal we also have to move forward.\n",
            "You see, earlier there was only one Lab for testing in our country. Today there is a network of 1400 Labs, spread in every corner of the country. In the initial stage of the Corona crisis, only 300 tests could be conducted in one day, but in such a short span of time, our people have shown that today we can conduct more than 7 lakh tests per day. We started with 300 and reached 7 lakhs!\n",
            "We are making continuous efforts towards modernization, construction of new AIIMS and new Medical Colleges in the country. In five years, the MBBS and MD seats have been increased for more than 45 thousand students. There are more than 1.5 lakh wellness centers in the villages and about one-third of them are already functional, which have helped a lot during this Corona pandemic. The Wellness Centers in the Corona times have helped the villages immensely.\n",
            "A massive campaign is going to start in the health sector from today and technology will also play a major role in it.\n",
            "The National Digital Health Mission is also being launched from today. It will bring a new revolution in India’s Health Sector. Technology will be used prudently to reduce the challenges in treatment.\n",
            "Every Indian will be given a Health ID. This Health ID will work like a Health Account of every Indian. This account will contain your details of  every test, every disease, the doctors you visited, the medicines you took and the diagnosis. When and what was the report, all such information will be incorporated in the Health ID.\n",
            "The National Digital Health Mission will eliminate all these difficulties related to appointment with a doctor, depositing money, making a slip in the hospital, etc. We are devising a system which will help each and every citizen to make a better and informed decision.\n",
            "My dear countrymen, there is a curiosity among everybody when the Corona vaccine will be ready. This is natural. This anxiety is there in everybody and everywhere in the world.\n",
            "I would like to tell my countrymen that our scientists are dutifully  engaged in the laboratories.  They are putting in great efforts. At present, testing for three vaccines is in different stages in the country. Once we get a green signal from our scientists, we will launch massive production of the vaccine. We have made all the preparations. We have drawn an outline to ramp up the production of the vaccines and to make it available to each and every person in the shortest possible time. \n",
            "My dear countrymen, there are different scenes of development in different regions in our country. There are some regions which are well developed, whereas there are others which are left behind. I think this imbalance is an important challenge to make India self-reliant. As I said earlier, we are emphasizing on 110 ambitious districts. We want these districts to be at par with the developed ones. Our priority is to create an ecosystem for development and improve connectivity.\n",
            "Now you see. The western, central and eastern parts of the country — be it eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Northeast, or Odisha — have abundant reserves of natural wealth. The people of these regions are very capable, strong and talented, but there has been an imbalance in these regions due to the absence of opportunities. Therefore, we have taken several measures. We are developing Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, connecting the eastern region with the gas pipe line, developing new rail infrastructure and new ports. We are developing the entire infrastructure for the development in a very holistic way.\n",
            "Similarly, Leh-Ladakh, Jammu-Kashmir have been freed from Article 370. It has been one year now.  This one year is a major milestone in the new development journey of Jammu-Kashmir. This has been a year of providing basic rights to the women and to the Dalits. It has also been a year for our refugees to live a life of dignity. We have launched several campaigns like Back to Villages so that the villages get benefited. Today, the Ayushman Scheme is being used in the best possible way in the region of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh.\n",
            "My dear countrymen, the true strength of our democracy lies in the elected local bodies. It is a matter of pride for us that the peoples’ representatives of the local units in Jammu and Kashmir are actively pursuing a new era of development with activism and sensitivity. I congratulate their “panch, sarpanch”(village headmen) for their active participation in this development journey.\n",
            "The delimitation exercise is going on in Jammu-Kashmir under the leadership of a retired chief justice of the Supreme Court. We want early completion of the delimitation exercise so that there are early elections, there should be Jammu-Kashmir MLAs, its own cabinet, its Chief Minister so that it can march towards development with a new vigour. India is committed to it and is making all efforts in this regard.\n",
            "We have taken a bold step to meet the aspirations of the people of Ladakh by making it the Union Territory which has been their demand for the last several years. Nestled in the heights of the Himalayas, Ladakh is progressing towards new heights. Work is going on for a central university, setting up new research centres, new courses for hotel and management. Plan is also under way for the creation of 7,500 MW Solar Park. But, my dear countrymen, Ladakh has several specialties. Not only do we have to preserve them, we have to nurture them as well. As Sikkim has made its mark as an Organic State in the northeast, Ladakh, Leh and Kargil can also create their own niche as a Carbon Neutral unit. Indian government has joined hands with the locals of the region to create a new model of development as per their own requirements.\n",
            "My dear countrymen, India has shown that the march towards development is possible by balancing the environment. Today India is inspiring the entire world with its vision of one world, one sun and one grid, particularly in the field of solar energy.\n",
            "India has established itself as one of  the five countries in the world in the generation of renewable energy. India is both aware as well as involved in finding solutions to pollution. We are leaving no stone unturned whether it is the Swachh India campaign, smoke-less cooking gas,  LED campaign, CNG-based transportation, or electric mobility. We are emphasizing on increasing the use of ethanol to reduce pollution caused due to petrol. What was the condition of ethanol in our country five years ago? Five years ago, there used to be only 40 crore litre production of ethanol. It has risen to five times in the last five years. Today, we are producing 200 crore litres of ethanol which is proving to be very helpful towards our environment.\n",
            "My dear countrymen, we are working on a holistic approach to reduce pollution in the select 100 cities through an integrated approach and modern technology with people’s participation.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "India can say this proudly that it is one of the very few countries where its area under forests is expanding. India is committed towards the promotion and conservation of its Biodiversity. We have successfully carried forward Project Tiger and Project Elephant. The Tiger population has increased in India. In the coming days, we are starting ‘Project Lion’ for the Asiatic Lions. And under Project Lion the work on the required infrastructure for the protection and security of Indian lions and in particular, the special type of health infrastructure required will be undertaken. And emphasis will be laid on Project Lion.\n",
            "Also, one more work we want to promote and that is – Project Dolphin. We will focus on both types of dolphins living in the rivers and in the seas. This will also give a boost to Biodiversity and  also create employment opportunities. This is also a center of attraction for tourism. So, we are going to move forward in this direction too.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "When we embark on an extraordinary journey with an extraordinary goal, the path will also be  full of challenges and these challenges too are extraordinary. Notwithstanding the recent adversities, there have been misadventures along the border which  threw a challenge to the country. But whoever tried to threaten the sovereignty of our country right from the LOC to the LAC, the army of the country, our brave soldiers have given a befitting reply.\n",
            "The whole country is full of zeal, driven by conviction and moving forward with unwavering devotion to protect India’s sovereignty. The world has seen what our brave Jawans can do in Ladakh,, what the country can do to defend its resolve.  Today, I pay obeisance to all the brave men and soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the motherland from the ramparts of the Red Fort.\n",
            "Be it terrorism or expansionism, India is fighting  against it valiantly. Today, the world’s faith in India has become stronger. Recently, as a non-Permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, 184 countries out of 192 supported India. This is a matter of great pride for every Indian. This is an example of how we have made our place in the world. And this is possible only when India itself is strong, India is powerful and safe. With this thinking, work is being carried out on many fronts today.\n",
            "My dear countrymen,\n",
            "We are establishing deep relations based on security, development and trust with our neighbouring countries whether connected by sea or land. India has been making continuous efforts to deepen its decades-old cultural, economic and social ties with its neighbouring countries.\n",
            "The world’s one-fourth population lives in South Asia. We can create countless opportunities for the welfare of such a large population through cooperation and partnership. There is a huge and significant responsibility on the part of all the leaders of the countries in this region for the progress and development of such a vast population. I call upon all the people, political leaders, parliamentarians and intellectuals of South Asia to fulfil their responsibility. The peace and harmony in this entire region will be of immense help to the welfare of humanity. The interests of the entire world are intertwined with it.\n",
            "Today, neighbours are not the only ones with whom we share geographical boundaries, but also those with whom we have close and harmonious relations. It is my pleasure that India has strengthened its relationship with all the countries in its extended neighbourhood in the last few years. The political, economic and human relations with the countries in West Asia have progressed manifold. Trust has increased manifold. The economic ties, particularly in the field of energy sector, are very important with these countries. There are a large number of people from India who are working in many of these countries. India is indebted to all these countries for their help to the Indian community during the Corona crisis by honouring India’s request. I want to personally thank them.\n",
            "Similarly, our ASEAN countries in the east, who are our maritime neighbours, also hold special importance. India has thousands of years old religious and cultural ties with these countries. The traditions of Buddhism connect us with them. Today, India is strengthening its cooperation not only in the field of  security but also in the areas of marine wealth with these countries.\n",
            "My dear citizens, India has as much commitment to make its security apparatus & armies strong as it has for establishing peace & harmony. Mammoth steps have been taken in the field of defence production, to make self-reliant India. Recently, we have put a stop on the import of more than 100 military equipment. From missiles to light military helicopters, from assault rifles to transport aircraft – all will be made in India. Our Tejas is getting ready to equip itself as per the modern requirements, for putting up a show of its majesty, speed and strength. Our borders and coastal infrastructure play a pivotal role in national security. Today emphasis is being laid on connectivity in every direction, be it at Himalayan peaks, or the islands of Indian Ocean. New roads are being constructed everywhere, from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, keeping in mind national security.\n",
            "Dear citizens, we have such a vast coastline. Alongside, we have over 1300 islands. Keeping the importance of a few identified islands in mind, we are developing them very fast. You must have seen, last week, five days back, a submarine optical fiber cable project in Andaman and Nicobar Islands was dedicated to the nation. Andaman and Nicobar islands will now have the internet facility just like Delhi and Chennai. Soon we will move forth in connecting Lakshadweep islands in the similar manner.\n",
            "We are aiming at providing high speed internet connectivity to Lakshadweep islands in the next 1000 days. Alongwith the security and development, the youth residing in the coastal area and near borders mind, we are working on developmental projects and taking steps, starting a big campaign.\n",
            "About 173 districts in our border areas, our coastal areas share their boundaries with some or the other nation’s border or coastline. In the coming days, NCC would be extended in those border districts for the youth there. We will train around one lakh new NCC cadets from bordering areas, and we will work towards the idea that amongst those, one-third of them are our daughters. The Army will train these border area cadets. The cadets for coastal areas would be trained by the navy and wherever there is an air base, the air force will train those cadets. The border and coastal areas would get trained manpower for disaster management, and the youth would also get skill training for making their career in the armed forces.\n",
            "Dear citizens, last year in my address from the Red Fort, I had said that the previous  five years were for meeting the prerequisites, and next five years would be for fulfillment of aspirations. In last year itself, the nation has achieved many big and important milestones. On the 150th year of Gandhi’s birth anniversary, India freed its villages from open defecation. Be it the Citizenship Amendment Act for the refugees suffering due to their beliefs, reservation rights for Dalits/Backwards/SCs/STs/OBCs, historic peace agreement in Assam and Tripura, appointment of Chief of Defence staff for making the collective power of armies more effective, or the construction of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor in a record period, India has created history, it saw history being created, extraordinary feats were achieved. \n",
            "Ten days ago, the construction of Lord Rama’s magnificent temple in Ayodhya began. A peaceful culmination has been achieved to the age-old issue of Ram Janmbhoomi. The citizens of India have shown an exemplary restraint and wisdom, and acted responsibly. It is simply unprecedented and a motivating factor for the future. Peace, unity and harmony- these are going to be the strengths of self-reliant India. This harmony, goodwill- this is the guarantee of prosperous future of India. We need to advance with this harmony. Each Indian must sacrifice something or the other in the magnanimous yajna for development.\n",
            "India will move forward with new policy, new customs in this decade. Now banal won’t work. The time has gone when casual attitude used to suffice. We are no less than anyone in the world. We will thrive to be the best. For this, we need to work towards being best in manufacturing, best in human resources, finest in governance, and aim to make a headway while achieving the best in every field by the 75th anniversary of our Independence.\n",
            "Our policies, processes, products- everything must be par excellence, the best, and then only the idea of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ can be achieved. Today, again we need to take a resolve that we will fulfill the dreams of those who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. This pledge must be for 1.3 billion citizens, for our future generations, for their bright future, for the self-reliant India. We must take a pledge, we must take an oath, that we will contribute towards reducing the import dependence, we will empower our small-scale industries, we all will be vocal for local. we will innovate more, empower our youth, women, scheduled tribes, scheduled castes, specially differently-abled, economically weaker sections, villages, backward classes, and everyone.\n",
            "Today India has made impossible possible at an extraordinary pace. With the same willpower, similar dedication, same passion, each Indian must move forward. \n",
            "Soon we will be celebrating the festival of the 75th year of our Independence in the year 2022. We are just one step away. We must burn the midnight oil. This third decade of the 21st century should be the decade when we fulfill our dreams. Corona is a big hurdle, but not that huge that it can stop us from moving ahead on the victorious path of self-reliant India.\n",
            "I can see the dawn of a new era for India, rise of new self-confidence, a bugle of  echo of self-reliant India. Once again, I extend my heartiest best wishes of Independence Day to all. Let’s all come together, and raise our hands, and say with all the power at our command: –\n",

A new 21st century tax system ‘Transparent Taxation - Honoring the Honest’ has been launched today.\n",

However, the facility of faceless appeal will be available for citizens across the country from 25th September which marks the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay. Now, even as the tax system is becoming faceless, it is infusing confidence in the taxpayers in terms of fairness and fearlessness.\n",

And it is not as if we stop after one reform. It is a continuous process. In the last few years more than 1500 archaic laws have been abolished in the country.\n",
            "India was at number 134 in Ease of Doing Business ranking a few years ago. Today India’s ranking is 63. There are many reforms and changes in various rules and laws behind such a big jump in the ranking. Seeing this commitment of India towards reforms, the confidence of foreign investors in India is also increasing continuously. The inflow of record FDI into India even during the Corona pandemic is an example of the same.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "Fundamental and Structural Reforms were needed in the tax system of India because our current system was created in the British period and then evolved slowly. After independence, a lot of changes were made here and there, but the character of the system remained largely the same.\n",
            "As a result, the taxpayer, who is a strong pillar of nation building, who is taken to lift the country out of poverty, has always been questioned. The notice of income tax became a decree. Many people had to face unnecessary trouble so that a handful of people who had cheated the country could be identified. When the number of tax payers should have been expanded with pride, a system of collusion and connivance emerged.\n",
            "In this quandary, the black and white money industry also flourished. This system crushed the honest businessmen, the employers, and the aspirations of the youth power of the country instead of encouraging honest business.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "Compliance is also difficult where there is complexity. The number of laws should be as less as possible. If the law is transparent, then both the taxpayers as well as the country are happy. This work is being done for some time now. Like, GST has replaced dozens of taxes. Arrangements range from filing returns to refunds were made entirely online.\n",
            "The new tax slab system has freed the compulsion of unnecessarily submitting papers and documents. Moreover, the government used to reach the High Court and Supreme Court on disputes above Rs 10 lakh. Now the limit has been raised to up to 1 crore rupees in the High Courts and up to 2 crores rupees in the Supreme Court. Attempts are being made to ensure that most cases are settled out of court through schemes like ‘Vivaad se Vishwas’. As a result of this, around 3 lakh cases have been resolved in a very short time.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "Besides reducing the complexities of the procedures, tax has also been reduced in the country. Tax is now zero on income of 5 lakh rupees. The tax has also come down in the remaining slabs. We are one of the lowest tax imposing countries in the world in terms of corporate tax.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "Our effort is to ensure that our tax system is Seamless, Painless and Faceless. Seamless means that the tax administration should work to solve the problem every taxpayer instead of complicating things. Painless means everything from technology to rules is made simple. Faceless means one should not be concerned about who is the Taxpayer and who is the Tax Officer. These reforms coming into force from today are going to take this thinking forward.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "Till now, the tax department of the city where we live used to handle all the things related to taxes. Be it scrutiny, notice, survey or seizure, the Income Tax Department of the same city played the main role of Income Tax Officer. Now this role has ended in a way. Now it has been changed with the help of technology.\n",
            "Now the scrutiny of cases may be allocated randomly to any officer in any region of the country. For example, the task of investigating a matter related to filing the return of a Mumbai taxpayer will not go to the Mumbai officer; but it is possible that it may go to a faceless team of Chennai. And the order that will come out from there might be reviewed by the team of another city, like Jaipur or Bengaluru. Now what will be the faceless team, who will be included in it, will also be decided randomly! There will also be changes in it every year.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "With this system, the taxpayer and the income tax office will not get any chance to get acquainted or influenced. All will work according to their respective obligations. The advantage to the department will be that there will not be unnecessary litigation. Unnecessary energy spent on the transfer-posting can also be avoided. Similar, besides investigation of tax related cases, the appeal will now be faceless.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "The Taxpayers' Charter is also a major step in the country’s development journey. For the first time in the history of India, the rights and duties of taxpayers have been codified. India has also joined the few countries which have given this level of respect and protection to taxpayers.\n",
            "The taxpayer is now assured of fair, courteous and rational behavior. That is, the income tax department now has to take care of the taxpayer's dignity and sensibility. Now the department has to trust the taxpayer, the department cannot doubt him unnecessarily or without any basis. Even if there is any doubt, the taxpayer is now empowered to make an appeal and ask for a review.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "Rights always come with obligations and duties. This charter also contains certain requirements from taxpayers. Paying tax by the taxpayer or imposing tax by the government is not a matter of right, but a responsibility of both the sides. Taxpayers have to pay taxes because the system runs from that and the country can fulfill its duty towards the teeming millions of the country.\n",
            "With this tax itself, the taxpayer also gets better facilities and infrastructure for progress. At the same time, it is the responsibility of the government to properly utilize every penny paid by the taxpayer. In such a situation, when the taxpayers are getting convenience and security, the country also expects every taxpayer to be more aware of their obligations.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "It is also important to understand how the impact of the trust on the countrymen, is seen on the ground. Out of all the tax returns filed in the year 2012-13, there was scrutiny of 0.94%. In the year 2018-19, this figure has come down to 0.26%. That is, the scrutiny of the cases has reduced by almost 4 times. Scrutiny reduced by 4 times itself shows how extensive the change is.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "In the last 6 years, India has witnessed a new model of governance developing in the tax administration. We have decreased complexity, decreased taxes, decreased litigation, increased transparency, increased tax compliance, increased trust on the tax payer.\n",
            "Friends,\n",
            "Amidst all these efforts, the number of people filing income tax returns in the last 6-7 years has increased by about 2.5 crores. But it is also true that in a country of 130 crores it is still very less. In such a large country only 1.5 crore people pay the income tax. I will urge the people of my country, those who are capable of paying taxes as well as those running the various industrial organizations to think over it. The country has to introspect on this matter. Introspection is necessary and indispensable for a self-reliant India. And this responsibility is not just with the tax department, but for every Indian. I request all those who are able to pay tax, but are not in the tax net yet, to come forward with self-motivation. 15th August is just two days ahead. Let us commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives for the country’s freedom. You too will feel like making a contribution.\n",
            "Come let us fulfill the resolve of the New India, self-reliant India, respecting the spirit of this platform of trust, rights and duties. Once again, congratulations to the present and the future honest tax payers of the country, I wish them all the best and this has been a major decision! I thank thank the Income Tax officials enough. Every taxpayer should also congratulate the income tax authorities because in a way they have restrained themselves. They have cut down on their own strength and rights. Who would not be proud if the officers of Income Tax Department come forward in this manner! Every countryman should be proud about it. And probably in the past, due to the system, people would not have liked to tread the path of paying taxes. Now the path that has been created has become an attractive way to pay taxes. And so, let us also take advantage of this system to build a magnificent India and come forward to join this system. I once again thank you very much and wish you all the best! I also thank Nirmala ji and her entire team for taking a number of positive decisions that have long lasting effects for the bright future of the country. I once again congratulate everyone, thank you all.\n",
