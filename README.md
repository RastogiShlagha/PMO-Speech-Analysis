# PMO-Speech-Analysis

Language Used - The analysis was done in Python3.

Data Collection - Used BeautifulSoup to crawl PM's Speech website https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/tag/pmspeech/

Hurdles -

1. The most recent speech available on PMO's website is in Hindi. Used GoogleTrans module to convert hindi text to english for further analysis.
2. The base website of PMO shows only 10 most recent speeches. Tried using Selenium for auto-scrolling the site to get more links to the later on speeches.

Working on -

1. Exploring other options for auto-scrolling to get more than 10 speeches.
2. Understanding Selenium for the above mission.
